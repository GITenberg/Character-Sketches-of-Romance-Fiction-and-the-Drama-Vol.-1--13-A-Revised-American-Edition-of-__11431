<p>&nbsp;<b>A'RON</b>, a Moor, beloved by Tam'ora, queen of the
Goths, in the tragedy of <i>Titus Andron'icus</i>, published among the plays
of Shakespeare (1593).</p>

<p>(The classic name is <i>Andronicus</i>, but the character of this play is
purely fictitious.)</p>

<p><i>Aaron (St.)</i>, a British martyr of the City of Legions (<i>Newport</i>, in
South Wales). He was torn limb from limb by order of Maximian'us
Hercu'lius, general in Britain, of the army of Diocle'tian. Two churches
were founded in the City of Legions, one in honor of St. Aaron and one
in honor of his fellow-martyr, St. Julius. Newport was called Caerleon
by the British.</p>

... two others ... sealed their doctrine with<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">their blood;</span><br>
St. Julius, and with him St. Aaron, have their<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">room</span><br>
At Carleon, suffering death by Diocletian's doom.<br>
Drayton, <i>Polyolbion</i>, xxiv, (1622).<br>

<p><b>Aaz'iz</b> (3 <i>syl.</i>), so the queen of Sheba or Saba is sometimes
called; but in the Koran she is called Balkis (ch. xxvii.).</p>

<p><b>Abad'don</b>, an angel of the bottomless pit (<i>Rev</i>. ix. 11). The word
is derived from the Hebrew, <i>abad</i>, &quot;lost,&quot; and means <i>the lost one</i>.
There are two other angels introduced by Klopstock in <i>The Messiah</i> with
similar names, but must not be confounded with the angel referred to in
<i>Rev</i>.; one is Obaddon, the angel of death, and the other Abbad'ona, the
repentant devil.</p>

<p><b>Ab'aris</b>, to whom Apollo gave a golden arrow, on which to ride
through the air.&mdash;See <i>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>.</p>

<p><b>Abbad'ona,</b> once the friend of Ab'diel, was drawn into the rebellion
of Satan half unwillingly. In hell he constantly bewailed his fall, and
reproved Satan for his pride and blasphemy. He openly declared to the
internals that he would take no part or lot in Satan's scheme for the
death of the Messiah, and during the crucifixion lingered about the
cross with repentance, hope, and fear. His ultimate fate we are not
told, but when Satan and Adramelech are driven back to hell, Obaddon,
the angel of death, says&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;For thee, Abbadona, I have no orders.
How long thou art permitted to remain on
earth I know not, nor whether thou wilt be
allowed to see the resurrection of the Lord of
glory ... but be not deceived, thou canst not
view Him with the joy of the redeemed.&quot; &quot;Yet
let me see Him, let me see him!&quot;&mdash;Klopstock,
<i>The Messiah</i>, xiii.</p>

<p><b>Abberville</b> (<i>Lord</i>), a young nobleman, 23 years of age, who has for
travelling tutor a Welshman of 65, called Dr. Druid, an antiquary,
wholly ignorant of his real duties as a guide of youth. The young man
runs wantonly wild, squanders his money, and gives loose to his passions
almost to the verge of ruin, but he is arrested and reclaimed by his
honest Scotch bailiff or financier, and the vigilance of his father's
executor, Mr. Mortimer. This &quot;fashionable lover&quot; promises marriage to a
vulgar, malicious city minx named Lucinda Bridgemore, but is saved from
this pitfall also.&mdash;Cumberland, <i>The Fashionable Lover</i> (1780).</p>

<p><b>Abbot</b> (<i>The</i>), the complacent churchman in Aldrich's poem of <i>The
Jew's Gift</i>, who hanged a Jew &quot;just for no crime,&quot; and pondered and
smiled and gave consent to the heretic's burial&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Since he gave his beard to the birds.&quot; (1881.)</p>

<p><b>Abdal-azis,</b> the Moorish governor of Spain after the overthrow of
king Roderick. When the Moor assumed regal state and affected Gothic
sovereignty, his subjects were so offended that they revolted and
murdered him. He married Egilona, formerly the wife of Roderick.&mdash;
Southey, <i>Roderick, etc</i>., xxii. (1814).</p>

<p><b>Ab'dalaz'iz</b> (<i>Omar ben</i>), a caliph raised to &quot;Mahomet's bosom&quot; in
reward of his great abstinence and self-denial.&mdash;<i>Herbelot</i>, 690.</p>

<p>He was by no means scrupulous; nor did he think with the caliph Omar ben
Abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to enjoy
paradise in the next.&mdash;W. Beckford, <i>Vathek</i> (1786).</p>

<p><b>Abdal'dar,</b> one of the magicians in the Domdaniel caverns, &quot;under
the roots of the ocean.&quot; These spirits were destined to be destroyed by
one of the race of Hodei'rah (3 <i>syl</i>.), so they persecuted the race
even to death. Only one survived, named Thal'aba, and Abdaldar was
appointed by lot to find him out and kill him. He discovered the
stripling in an Arab's tent, and while in prayer was about to stab him
to the heart with a dagger, when the angel of death breathed on him, and
he fell dead with the dagger in his hand. Thalaba drew from the
magician's finger a ring which gave him command over the spirits.
&mdash;Southey, <i>Thalaba the Destroyer</i>, ii. iii. (1797).</p>

<p><b>Abdalla</b>, one of sir Brian de Bois Guilbert's slaves.&mdash;Sir W. Scott,
<i>Ivanhoe</i> (time, Richard I.).</p>

<p><i>Abdal'lah</i>, brother and predecessor of Giaf'fer (2 <i>syl</i>.), pacha of
Aby'dos. He was murdered by the pacha.&mdash;Byron, <i>Bride of Abydos</i>.</p>

<p><b>Abdallah el Hadgi</b>, Saladin's envoy.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>The Talisman</i>
(time, Richard I.).</p>

<p><b>Abdals</b> or <i>Santons</i>, a class of religionists who pretend to be
inspired with the most ravishing raptures of divine love. Regarded with
great veneration by the vulgar.&mdash;<i>Olearius</i>, i. 971.</p>

<p><b>Ab'diel</b>, the faithful seraph who withstood Satan when he urged
those under him to revolt.</p>

... the seraph Abdiel, faithful found;<br>
Among the faithless faithful only he;<br>
Among innumerable false, unmoved.<br>
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,<br>
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Milton, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, v. 896, etc. (1665).</span><br>

<p><b>Abelard</b> and <b>Eloise</b>, unhappy lovers, whose illicit love was
succeeded by years of penitence and remorse. Abelard was the tutor of
Heloise (or Eloise), and, although vowed to the church, won and returned
her passion. They were violently separated by her uncle. Abelard entered
a monastery and Eloise became a nun. Their love survived the passage of
years, and they were buried together at <i>P&egrave;re la Chaise.&mdash;Eloise and
Abelard</i>. By Alexander Pope (1688-1744).</p>

<p><b>Abensberg</b> (<i>Count</i>), the father of thirty-two children. When
Heinrich II. made his progress through Germany, and other courtiers
presented their offerings, the count brought forward his thirty-two
children, &quot;as the most valuable offering he could make to his king and
country.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Abes'sa</b>, the impersonation of abbeys and convents in Spenser's
<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, i. 3. She is the paramour of Kirkrapine, who used to rob
churches and poor-boxes, and bring his plunder to Abessa, daughter of
Corceca (<i>Blindness of Heart</i>).</p>

<p><b>Abigail</b>, typical name of a maid.&mdash;See Beaumont and Fletcher, Swift,
Fielding, and many modern writers.</p>

<p><b>Abney</b>, called <i>Young Abney</i>, the friend of colonel Albert Lee, a
royalist.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>Woodstock</i> (time, the Commonwealth).</p>

<p><b>Abon Hassan</b>, a young merchant of Bag dad, and hero of the tale
called &quot;The Sleeper Awakened,&quot; in the <i>Arabian Nights' Entertainments</i>.
While Abon Hassan is asleep he is conveyed to the palace of
Haroun-al-Raschid, and the attendants are ordered to do everything they
can to make him fancy himself the caliph. He subsequently becomes the
caliph's chief favorite.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, in the induction of <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, befouls
&quot;Christopher Sly&quot; in a similar way, but Sly thinks it was &quot;nothing but a
dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Philippe <i>le Bon</i>, duke of Burgundy, on his marriage with Eleonora,
tried the same trick.&mdash;Burton, <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, ii. 2,4.</p>

<p><b>Abou Ben Adhem</b>, &quot;awakening one night from a deep dream of peace,&quot;
sees an angel writing the names of those who love the Lord. Ben Adhem's
name is registered as &quot;one who loves his fellow-men.&quot; A second vision
shows his name at the head of the list.</p>

<p><i>Abou Ben Adhem</i>. By Leigh Hunt (1784-1859).</p>

<p><b>Abra</b>, the most beloved of Solomon's
concubines.<br>
Fruits their odor lost and meats their taste,<br>
If gentle Abra had not decked the feast;<br>
Dishonored did the sparkling goblet stand,<br>
Unless received from gentle Abra's hand; ...<br>
Nor could my soul approve the music's tone<br>
Till all was hushed, and Abra sang alone.<br>
M. Prior, <i>Solomon</i> (1664-1721).</p>

<p><b>Ab'radas</b>, the great Macedonian pirate.</p>

<p>Abradas, the great Macedonian pirate, thought every one had a letter of
mart that bare sayles in the ocean.&mdash;Greene, <i>Penelope's Web</i> (1601).</p>

<p><b>Abroc'omas</b>, the lover of An'thia in the Greek romance of
<i>Ephesi'aca</i>, by Xenophon of Ephesus (not the historian).</p>

<p><b>Ab'salom</b>, in Dryden's <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, is meant for the
duke of Monmouth, natural son of Charles II. <i>(David)</i>. Like Absalom,
the duke was handsome; like Absalom, he was beloved and rebellious; and
like Absalom, his rebellion ended in his death (1649-1685).</p>

<p><b>Ab'solon,</b> a priggish parish clerk in Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.
His hair was curled, his shoes slashed, his hose red. He could let
blood, cut hair, and shave, could dance, and play either on the ribible
or the gittern. This gay spark paid his addresses to Mistress Alison,
the young wife of John, a rich but aged carpenter: but Alison herself
loved a poor scholar named Nicholas, a lodger in the house.&mdash;<i>The
Miller's Tale</i> (1388).</p>

<p><b>Absolute</b> <i>(Sir Anthony)</i>, a testy but warm-hearted old gentleman,
who imagines that he possesses a most angelic temper, and when he
quarrels with his son, the captain, fancies it is the son who is out of
temper, and not himself. Smollett's &quot;Matthew Bramble&quot; evidently
suggested this character. William Dowton (1764-1851) was the best actor
of this part.</p>

<p><i>Captain Absolute</i>, son of sir Anthony, in love with Lydia Languish, the
heiress, to whom he is known only as ensign Beverley. Bob Acres, his
neighbor, is his rival, and sends a challenge to the unknown ensign; but
when he finds that ensign Beverley is captain Absolute, he declines to
fight, and resigns all further claim to the lady's hand.&mdash;Sheridan, <i>The
Rivals</i> (1775).</p>

<p><b>Absyrtus</b>, brother of Medea and companion of her flight from
Colchis. To elude or delay her pursuers, she cut him into pieces and
strewed the fragments in the road, that her father might be detained by
gathering up the remains of his son.</p>

<p><i>Abu'dah</i>, in the drama called <i>The Siege of Damascus</i>, by John Hughes
(1720), is the next in command to Caled in the Arabian army set down
before Damascus. Though undoubtedly brave, he prefers peace to war; and
when, at the death of Caled, he succeeds to the chief command, he makes
peace with the Syrians on honorable terms.</p>

<p><b>Abu'dah</b>, in the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>, by H. Ridley, is a wealthy
merchant of Bag dad, who goes in quest of the talisman of Oroma'nes,
which he is driven to seek by a little old hag, who haunts him every
night and makes his life wretched. He finds at last that the talisman
which is to free him of this hag [<i>conscience</i>] is to &quot;fear God and keep
his commandments.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Acade'mus</b>, an Attic hero, whose garden was selected by Plato for
the place of his lectures. Hence his disciples were called the &quot;Academic
sect.&quot;</p>

<p>The green retreats of Academus. Akenside, <i>Pleasures of Imagination</i>, i
(1721-1770).</p>

<p><b>Acas'to</b> (<i>Lord</i>), father of Seri'no, Casta'lio, and Polydore; and
guardian of Monimia &quot;the orphan.&quot; He lived to see the death of his sons
and his ward. Polydore ran on his brother's sword, Castalio stabbed
himself, and Monimia took poison.&mdash;Otway, <i>The Orphan</i> (1680).</p>

<p><b>Aces'tes</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.). In a trial of skill,
Acestes, the Sicilian, discharged his arrow
with such force that it took fire from the
friction of the air.&mdash;<i>The &AElig;neid</i>, Bk. V.</p>

Like Acestes' shaft of old,<br>
The swift thought kindles as it flies.<br>

<p>Longfellow, <i>To a Child</i>.</p>

<p><b>Achates</b> [<i>A-ka'-teze</i>], called by Virgil
&quot;fidus Achates.&quot; The name has become a
synonym for a bosom friend, a crony, but
is generally used laughingly.&mdash;<i>The &AElig;neid</i>.</p>

He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb.<br>

<p>Byron, <i>Don Juan</i>, i. 159.</p>

<p><b>Acher'ia,</b> the fox, went partnership with a bear in a bowl of: milk.
Before the bear arrived, the fox skimmed off the cream and drank the
milk; then, filling the bowl with mud, replaced the cream atop. Says the
fox, &quot;Here is the bowl; one shall have the cream, and the other all the
rest: choose, friend, which you like.&quot; The bear told the fox to take the
cream, and thus bruin had only the mud.&mdash;<i>A Basque Tale</i>.</p>

<p>A similar tale occurs in Campbell's <i>Popular Tales of the West
Highlands</i> (iii. 98), called &quot;The Keg of Butter.&quot; The wolf chooses the
<i>bottom</i> when &quot;oats&quot; were the object of choice, and the <i>top</i> when
&quot;potatoes&quot; were the sowing.</p>

<p>Rabelais tells the same tale about a farmer and the devil. Each was to
have on alternate years what grew <i>under</i> and <i>over</i> the soil. The
farmer sowed turnips and carrots when the <i>under</i>-soil produce came to
his lot, and barley or wheat when his turn was the <i>over</i>-soil produce.</p>

<p><b>Achille Grandissime,</b> &quot;A rather poor specimen of the Grandissime
type, deficient in stature, but not in stage manner.&quot;&mdash;<i>The
Grandissimes</i>, by George W. Cable (1880).</p>

<p><b>Achil'les</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), the hero of the allied Greek army in the
siege of Troy, and king of the Myr'midons.&mdash;See <i>Dictionary of Phrase
and Fable</i>.</p>

<p><i>The English Achilles</i>, John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury
(1373-1453).</p>

<p>The duke of Wellington is so called sometimes, and is represented by a
statue of Achilles of gigantic size in Hyde Park, London, close to
Apsley House (1769-1852).</p>

<p><b>Acres</b> (<i>Bob</i>), a country gentleman, the rival of ensign Beverley,

subject. Thus if duels are spoken of he says, <i>ods triggers and flints</i>;
if clothes, <i>ods frogs and tambours</i>; if music, <i>ods minnums</i> [minims]

from a militia officer, who told him the ancients swore by Jove,
Bacchus, Mars, Venus, Minerva, etc., according to the sentiment. Bob
Acres is a great blusterer, and talks big of his daring, but when put to
the push &quot;his courage always oozed out of his fingers' ends.&quot; J. Quick

<p><b>Acris'ius</b>, father of Dan'a&ecirc;. An oracle declared that Dana&ecirc; would
give birth to a son who would kill him, so Acrisius kept his daughter
shut up in an apartment under ground, or (as some say) in a brazen
tower. Here she became the mother of Per'seus (2 <i>syl</i>.), by Jupiter in
the form of a shower of gold. The king of Argos now ordered his daughter
and her infant to be put into a chest, and cast adrift on the sea, but
they were rescued by Dictys, a fisherman. When grown to manhood, Perseus
accidentally struck the foot of Acrisius with a quoit, and the blow
caused his death. This tale is told by Mr. Morris in <i>The Earthly

Dusis, [Greek: <i>dusis</i>]. west.<br>
Anatol&ecirc;, [Greek: <i>anatolae</i>]. east.<br>
Mesembria, [Greek: <i>mesaembria</i>]. south.<br>

<p>The <i>Hebrew</i> word ADM forms the anagram of <b>A</b> [dam], <b>D</b> [avid],
<b>M</b> [essiah].</p>

<p><i>Adam, how made</i>. God created the body of Adam of <i>Salzal</i>, <i>i.e.</i> dry,
unbaked clay, and left it forty nights without a soul. The clay was
collected by Azrael from the four quarters of the earth, and God, to
show His approval of Azrael's choice, constituted him the angel of
death.&mdash;Rabadan.</p>

<p><i>Adam, Eve, and the Serpent</i>. After the fall <i>Adam</i> was placed on mount
Vassem in the east; <i>Eve</i> was banished to Djidda (now Gedda, on the
Arabian coast); and the <i>Serpent</i> was exiled to the coast of Eblehh.</p>

<p>After the lapse of 100 years Adam rejoined Eve on mount Arafaith [<i>place
of Remembrance</i>], near Mecca.&mdash;D'Ohsson.</p>

<p><i>Death of Adam</i>. Adam died on Friday, April 7, at the age of 930 years.
Michael swathed his body, and Gabriel discharged the funeral rites. The
body was buried at Ghar'ul-Kenz [<i>the grotto of treasure</i>], which
overlooks Mecca.</p>

<p>His descendants at death amounted to 40,000 souls.&mdash;D'Ohsson.</p>

<p>When Noah, entered the ark (the same writer says) he took the body of
Adam in a coffin with him, and when he left the ark restored it to the

<p><i>Adam</i>, a faithful retainer in the family of sir Eowland de Boys. At the

into exile, and offered to give him his little savings. He has given
birth to the phrase, &quot;A Faithful Adam&quot; [<i>or man-servant</i>].&mdash;Shakespeare,

<p><b>Adam Bell</b>, a northern outlaw, noted for his archery. The name, like
those of Clym of the Clough, William of Cloudesly, Robin Hood, and
Little John, is synonymous with a good archer.</p>

<p><b>Adamastor</b>, the Spirit of the Cape, a hideous phantom, of unearthly
pallor; &quot;erect his hair uprose of withered red, his lips were black, his
teeth blue and disjointed, his beard haggard, his face scarred by
lightning, his eyes shot livid fire, his voice roared.&quot; The sailors
trembled at sight of him, and the fiend demanded how they dared to
trespass &quot;where never hero braved his rage before?&quot; He then told them
&quot;that every year the shipwrecked should be made to deplore their
foolhardiness.&quot;&mdash;Cam&ouml;ens, <i>The Lusiad</i>, v. (1569).</p>

<p><b>Adam'ida,</b> a planet on which reside the unborn spirits of saints,
martyrs, and believers. U'riel, the angel of the sun, was ordered at the
crucifixion to interpose this planet between the sun and the earth, so
as to produce a total eclipse.</p>

<p>Adamida, in obedience to the divine command, flew amidst overwhelming
storms, rushing clouds, falling mountains, and swelling seas. Uriel
stood on the pole of the star, but so lost in deep contemplation on
Golgotha, that he heard not the wild uproar. On coming to the region of
the sun, Adamida slackened her course, and advancing before the sun,
covered its face and intercepted all its rays.&mdash;Klopstock, <i>The
Messiah</i>, viii. (1771).</p>

<p><b>Adams</b> <i>(John)</i>, one of the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i> (1790), who

colony, brought up with a high sense of religion and strict regard to
morals. In 1839 the colony was voluntarily placed under the protection
of the British Government.</p>

<p><i>Adams (Parson)</i>, the beau-ideal of a simple-minded, benevolent, but
eccentric country clergyman, of unswerving integrity, solid learning,
and genuine piety; bold as a lion in the cause of truth, but modest as a
girl in all personal matters; wholly ignorant of the world, being
&quot;<i>in</i> it but not <i>of</i> of it.&quot;&mdash;Fielding, <i>Joseph Andrews</i> (1742).</p>

<p>His learning, his simplicity, his evangelical purity of mind are so
admirably mingled with pedantry, absence of mind, and the habit of
athletic ... exercise ... that he may be safely termed one of the
richest productions of the muse of fiction. Like Don Quixote, parson
Adams is beaten a little too much and too often, but the cudgel lights
upon his shoulders ... without the slightest stain to his
reputation.&mdash;Sir W. Scott.</p>

mountains, and the impression is that he has wilfully deserted her. She
cannot discredit it, but &quot;She's goin' ter stay thar in her cabin an'

<p><b>Adeline</b> <i>(Lady)</i>, the wife of lord Henry Amun'deville (4 <i>syl</i>.), a

Artegal comes to her rescue, attacks the two knights, and knocks one of
them from his saddle with such force that he breaks his neck. After the
discomfiture of the soldan, Adicia rushes forth with a knife to stab
Samient, but, being intercepted by sir Artegal, is changed into a
tigress.&mdash;Spenser, <i>Faery Queen</i>, v. 8 (1596).</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg"> The &quot;soldan&quot; is king Philip II. of Spain; &quot;Mercilla&quot; is

<p><b>Ado'nis</b>, a beautiful youth, beloved by Venus and Proser'pina, who
quarrelled about the possession of him. Jupiter, to settle the dispute,
decided that the boy should spend six months with Venus in the upper
world and six with Proserpina in the lower. Adonis was gored to death by
a wild boar in a hunt.</p>

<p>Shakespeare has a poem called <i>Venus and Adonis</i>. Shelley calls his
elegy on the poet Keats <i>Adona'is</i>, under the idea that the untimely
death of Keats resembled that of Adonis.</p>

<p>(<i>Adonis</i> is an allegory of the sun, which is six months north of the

<p><b>Adoniram Penn</b>, the obstinate and well-to-do farmer in Mary E.
Wilkins's <i>Revolt of &quot;Mother</i>&quot;. He persists in building a new barn which
the cattle do not need instead of the much-needed dwelling for his

husband in the humble fashion of a Scripture woman,&quot; moves household and
furniture into the commodious barn.</p>

<p>&quot;Adoniram was like a fortress whose walls had no active resistance, and

without the least resistance, but implored the captain to give her one
night to mourn the death of those so near and dear to her. To this he
complied, but during sleep she murdered him with his own scymitar.
Roderick, disguised as a monk, helped her to bury the dead bodies of her
house, and then she vowed to live for only one object, vengeance. In the
great battle, when the Moors were overthrown, she it was who gave the

<p>The Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adramelech.&mdash;2

<p>Klopstock introduces him into <i>The Messiah</i>, and represents him as
surpassing Satan in malice and guile, ambition and mischief. He is made
to hate every one, even Satan, of whose rank he is jealous, and whom he
hoped to overthrow, that by putting an end to his servitude he might
become the supreme god of all the created worlds. At the crucifixion he
and Satan are both driven back to hell by Obad'don, the angel of death.</p>

<p><b>Adraste'</b> (<i>2 syl</i>.), a French gentleman, who inveigles a Greek

her consent to elope with him. He then sends his slave Za&iuml;de (<i>2 syl</i>.)
to don P&egrave;dre, to crave protection for ill treatment, and P&egrave;dre promises
to befriend her. At this moment Adraste appears, and demands that Za&iuml;de
be given up to him to punish as he thinks proper. P&egrave;dre intercedes;
Adraste seems to relent; and P&egrave;dre calls for Za&iuml;de. Out comes Isidore
instead, with Za&iuml;de's veil. &quot;There,&quot; says P&egrave;dre, &quot;take her and use her

husband of infidelity, she says to the abbess, if he is unfaithful it is
not from want of remonstrance, &quot;for it is the one subject of our
conversation. In bed I will not let him sleep for speaking of it; at
table I will not let him eat for speaking of it; when alone with him I
talk of nothing else, and in company I give him frequent hints of it. In
a word, all my talk is how vile and bad it is in him to love another

<p><b>Aene'as,</b> a Trojan prince, the hero of Virgil's epic called
<i>Aeneid.</i> He was the son of Anchi'ses and Venus. His first wife was
Creu'sa (3 <i>syl</i>.), by whom he had a son named Asca'nius; his second
wife was Lavinia, daughter of Latinus king of Italy, by whom he had a
posthumous son called Aene'as Sylvius. He succeeded his father-in-law in
the kingdom, and the Romans called him their founder.</p>

<p>According to Geoffrey of Monmouth &quot;Brutus,&quot; the first king of Britain
(from whom the island was called <i>Britain</i>), was a descendant of &AElig;neas.</p>

<p><b>Aene'id</b>, the epic poem of Virgil, in twelve books. When Troy was
taken by the Greeks and set on fire, Aene'as, with his father, son, and
wife, took flight, with the intention of going to Italy, the original
birthplace of the family. The wife was lost, and the old father died on
the way; but after numerous perils by sea and land, &AElig;neas and his son
Asca'nius reached Italy. Here Lat&iuml;nus, the reigning king, received the
exiles hospitably, and promised his daughter Lavin'ia in marriage to
&AElig;neas; but she had been already betrothed by her mother to prince
Turnus, son of Daunus, king of Ru'tuli, and Turnus would not forego his
claim. Latinus, in this dilemma, said the rivals must settle the dispute
by an appeal to arms. Turnus being slain, &AElig;neas married Lavinia, and
ere long succeeded his father-in-law on the throne.</p>

<p>Book I. The escape from Troy; &AElig;neas and his son, driven by a tempest on
the shores of Carthage, are hospitably entertained by queen Dido.</p>

<p>II. &AElig;neas tells Dido the tale of the wooden horse, the burning of Troy,
and his flight with his father, wife, and son. The wife was lost and
died.</p>

<p>III. The narrative continued. The perils he met with on the way, and the
death of his father.</p>

<p>IV. Dido falls in love with &AElig;neas; but he steals away from Carthage,
and Dido, on a funeral pyre, puts an end to her life.</p>

<p>V. &AElig;neas reaches Sicily, and celebrates there the games in honor of
Anchises. This book corresponds to the <i>Iliad</i>, xxiii.</p>

<p>VI. &AElig;neas visits the infernal regions. This book corresponds to
<i>Odyssey</i>, xi.</p>

<p>VII. Latinus king of Italy entertains &AElig;neas, and promises to him

<p><b>Aladdin</b>, son of Mustafa, a poor tailor, of China, &quot;obstinate,
disobedent, and mischievous,&quot; wholly abandoned &quot;to indolence and
licentiousness.&quot; One day an African magician accosted him, pretending to
be his uncle, and sent him to bring up the &quot;wonderful lamp,&quot; at the same
time giving him a &quot;ring of safety.&quot; Aladdin secured the lamp, but would
not hand it to the magician till he was out of the cave, whereupon the
magician shut him up in the cave, and departed for Africa. Aladdin,
wringing his hands in despair, happened to rub the magic ring, when the
genius of the ring appeared before him, and asked him his commands.
Aladdin requested to be delivered from the cave, and he returned home.
By means of his lamp, he obtained untold wealth, built a superb palace,
and married Badroul'boudour, the sultan's daughter. After a time, the
African magician got possession of the lamp, and caused the palace, with
all its contents, to be transported into Africa. Aladdin was absent at
the time, was arrested and ordered to execution, but was rescued by the
populace, with whom he was an immense favorite, and started to discover
what had become of his palace. Happening to slip, he rubbed his ring,
and when the genius of the ring appeared and asked his orders, was
instantly posted to the place where his palace was in Africa. He
poisoned the magician, regained the lamp, and had his palace restored to
its original place in China.</p>

scrub it, intending to sell it, when the genius of the lamp appeared,
and asked her what were her commands. Aladdin answered, &quot;I am hungry;
bring me food;&quot; and immediately a banquet was set before him. Having
thus become acquainted with the merits of the lamp, he became enormously
rich, and married the sultan's daughter. By artifice the African
magician got possession of the lamp, and transported the palace with its
contents to Africa. Aladdin poisoned the magician, recovered the lamp,
and retranslated the palace to its original site.</p>

<p><i>Aladdin's Palace Windows</i>. At the top of the palace was a saloon,
containing tweny-four windows (six on each side), and all but one
enriched with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. One was left for the
sultan to complete, but all the jewellers in the empire were unable to
make one to match the others, so Aladdin commanded &quot;the slaves of the
lamp&quot; to complete their work.</p>

<p><b>Al'bion.</b> In legendary history this word is variously accounted for.
One derivation is from Albion, a giant, son of Neptune, its first
discoverer, who ruled over the island for forty-four years.</p>

<p>Another derivation is Al'bia, eldest of the fifty daughters of
Diocle'sian king of Syria. These fifty ladies all married on the same
day, and all murdered their husbands on the wedding night. By way of
punishment, they were cast adrift in a ship, unmanned, but the wind
drove the vessel to our coast, where these Syrian damsels disembarked.
Here they lived the rest of their lives, and married with the
aborigines, &quot;a lawless crew of devils.&quot; Milton mentions this legend, and
na&iuml;vely adds, &quot;it is too absurd and unconscionably gross to be
believed.&quot; Its resemblance to the fifty daughters of Dan'aos is
palpable.</p>

<p>Drayton, in his <i>Polyolbion</i>, says that Albion came from Rome, was &quot;the
first martyr of the land,&quot; and dying for the faith's sake, left his name
to the country, where Offa subsequently reared to him &quot;a rich and
sumptuous shrine, with a monastery attached.&quot;&mdash;Song xvi.</p>

brother, but Hercules took his father's part, and Albion was

<p>Alcestis or Alcestes, daughter of Pelias and wife of Admetus (<i>q. v</i>.)
On his wedding-day Admetus neglected to offer sacrifice to Diana and was
condemned to die, but Apollo induced the Fates to spare his life if he
could find a voluntary substitute. His wife offered to give her life for
his, and went away with death; but Hercules fought with Death and
restored Alcestes to her husband. This story is the subject of a tragedy
<i>Alcestes</i>, by Euripides. Milton alludes to the incident in one of his
sonnets:</p>

Methought I saw my late espoused saint<br>
Brought to me like Alcestes from the grave.<br>

<p>John Milton, Sonnet <i>On his deceased Wife</i>.</p>

<p>William Morris has made Alcestes the subject of one of the tales in his
<i>Earthly Paradise.</i></p>

<p>A variation of the story is found in Longfellow's <i>The Golden Legend</i>,
Henry of Hoheneck when dying was promised his life if a maiden could be
found who would give up her life for his. Elsie, the daughter of
Gottlieb, a tenant-farmer of the prince offered herself as a sacrifice,
and followed her lord to Sorrento to give herself up to Lucifer; but
Henry heard of it, and, moved by gratitude, saved Elsie and made her his
wife.</p>

is &quot;Subtle,&quot; a mere quack; and &quot;sir Epicure Mammon&quot; is the chief dupe,
who supplies money, etc., for the &quot;transmutation of metal.&quot; &quot;Abel
Drugger&quot; a tobacconist, and &quot;Dapper&quot; a lawyer's clerk, are two other

the false and true Amphitryon, which is augmented by Mercury, who
personates Sos'ia, the slave of Amphitryon. By this amour of Jupiter,

now went forth and found a stone almost of the weight required, and in
order to complete the balance, added a little earth; falling from his

<p><b>Am'adis of Gaul</b>, a love-child of king Per'ion and the princess
Elize'na. He is the hero of a famous prose romance of chivalry, the
first four books of which are attributed to Lobeira, of Portugal (died
1403). These books were translated into Spanish in 1460 by Montal'vo,
who added the fifth book. The five were rendered into French by
Herberay, who increased the series to twenty-four books. Lastly, Gilbert
Saunier added seven more volumes, and called the entire series <i>Le Roman
des Romans</i>.</p>

<p>Whether Amadis was French or British is disputed. Some maintain that
&quot;Gaul&quot; means <i>Wales</i>, not France; that Elizena was princess of
<i>Brittany</i> (Bretagne), and that Perion was king of Gaul (<i>Wales</i>), not
Gaul <i>(France).</i></p>

Amadis de Gaul was a tall man, of a fair complexion,<br>
his aspect something between mild and<br>
austere, and had a handsome black beard. He<br>
was a person of very few words, was not easily<br>
provoked, and was soon appeased.&mdash;Cervantes,<br>
<i>Don Quixote</i>, II. i. 1 (1615).<br>

<p>As Arthur is the central figure of British romance, Charlemagne of
French, and Diderick of German, so Amadis is the central figure of
Spanish and Portuguese romance; but there is this difference&mdash;the tale
of Amadis is a connected whole, terminating with his marriage with
Oria'na, the intervening parts being only the obstacles he encountered
and overcame in obtaining this consummation. In the Arthurian romances,
and those of the Charlemagne series, we have a number of adventures of
different heroes, but there is no unity of purpose; each set of
adventures is complete in itself.</p>

<p><b>Ama'dis of Greece</b>, a supplemental part of <i>Amadis of Gaul</i>, by
Felicia'no de Silva. There are also several other Amadises&mdash;as Amadis of
Colchis, Amadis of Trebisond, Amadis of Cathay, but all these are very
inferior to the original <i>Amadis of Gaul</i>.</p>

<p><b>Amal'ahta</b>, son of Erill'yab the deposed queen of the Hoamen (2

wished to marry the princess Goer'vyl, Madoc's sister, and even seized
her by force, but was killed in his flight.&mdash;Southey, <i>Madoc</i>, ii. 16
(1805).</p>

<p><b>Amalthae'a</b>, the sibyl who offered to sell to Tarquin nine books of
prophetic oracles. When the king refused to give her the price demanded,
she went away, burnt three of them, and returning to the king, demanded
the same price for the remaining six. Again the king declined the
purchase. The sibyl, after burning three more of the volumes, demanded
the original sum for the remaining three. Tarquin paid the money, and
Amalthaea was never more seen. Aulus Gellius says that Amalthaea burnt
the books in the king's presence. Pliny affirms that the original number
of volumes was only three, two of which the sibyl burnt, and the third
was purchased by king Tarquin.</p>

<p><b>Amalthe'a</b>, a mistress of Ammon and mother of Bacchus. Ammon hid his
mistress in the island Nysa (in Africa), in order to elude the vigilance
and jealousy of his wife Rhea. This account (given by Diodorus Sic'ulus,
bk. iii., and by sir Walter Raleigh in his <i>History of the World</i>, I.
vi. 5) differs from the ordinary story, which makes Sem'el&ecirc; the mother
of Bacchus, and Rhea his nurse. (Ammon is Ham or Cham, the son of Noah,
founder of the African race.)</p>

also pays attention to Loveless's wife, but she repels his advances with
indignation, and Loveless, who overhears her, conscious of his own
shortcomings, resolves to reform his ways, and, &quot;forsaking all other,&quot;
to remain true to Amanda, &quot;so long as they both should live.&quot;&mdash;Sheridan,

induced &quot;the sullen shepherd&quot; to dip her in &quot;the magic well,&quot; whereby
she became transformed into the perfect resemblance of her rival, and
soon effectually disgusted Perigot with her bold and wanton conduct.
When afterwards he met the true Amoret, he repulsed her, and even
wounded her with intent to kill. Ultimately, the trick was discovered by
Cor'in, &quot;the faithful shepherdess,&quot; and Perigot was married to his true
love.&mdash;John Fletcher, <i>The Faithful Shepherd</i> (1610).</p>

noble houses of Spenser and Marlborough. After the death of the earl,
the widow married sir Thomas Egerton, keeper of the Great Seal
(afterwards baron of Ellesmere and viscount Brackley). It was for this
very lady, during her widowhood, that Milton wrote his <i>Ar'cades</i> (3

former in love with the dowerless Lucy, and the latter with the wealthy
Philtra. The two brothers had each an island of equal size and value
left them by their father, but the sea daily added to the island of the
younger brother, and encroached on that belonging to Bracidas. When
Philtra saw that the property of Amidas was daily increasing, she
forsook the elder brother and married the wealthier; while Lucy, seeing
herself jilted, threw herself into the sea. A floating chest attracted
her attention, she clung to it, and was drifted to the wasted island. It
was found to contain great riches, and Lucy gave its contents and
herself to Bracidas. Amidas claimed the chest as his own by right, and
the question in dispute was submitted to sir Ar'tegal. The wise arbiter
decided, that whereas Armidas claimed as his own all the additions given
to his island by the sea, Lucy might claim as her own the chest, because
the sea had given it to her.&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, v. 4 (1596).</p>

<p><i>Am'ina</i>, an orphan, who walked in her sleep. She was betrothed to
Elvi'no, a rich farmer, but being found the night before the wedding in
the chamber of count Rodolpho, Elvino rightly refused to marry her. The
count remonstrated with the young farmer, and while they were talking,
the orphan was seen to get out of a window and walk along the narrow
edge of a mill-roof while the great wheel was rapidly revolving; she
then crossed a crazy old bridge, and came into the same chamber. Here
she awoke, and, seeing Elvino, threw her arms around him so lovingly,
that all his doubts vanished, and he married her.&mdash;Bellini, <i>La
Sonnambula</i> (an opera, 1831).</p>

<p><b>Am'ine</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), half-sister of Zobei'd&egrave; (3 <i>syl</i>.), and wife of
Amin, the caliph's son. One day she went to purchase a robe, and the
seller told her he would charge nothing if she would suffer him to kiss
her cheek. Instead of kissing he bit it, and Amine, being asked by her
husband how she came by the wound, so shuffled in her answers that he
commanded her to be put to death, a sentence he afterwards commuted to
scourging. One day she and her sister told the stories of their lives to
the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, when Amin became reconciled to his wife,
and the caliph married her half-sister.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights'Entertainments</i>
(&quot;History of Zobeide and History of Amine&quot;).</p>

<p><b>Am'ine</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.) or <b>Am'ines</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), the beautiful wife of
Sidi Nouman. Instead of eating her rice with a spoon, she used a bodkin
for the purpose, and carried it to her mouth in infinitesimal portions.
This went on for some time, till Sidi Nouman determined to ascertain on
what his wife really fed, and to his horror discovered that she was a
ghoul, who went stealthily by night to the cemetery, and feasted on the
freshly-buried dead.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights</i> (&quot;History of Sidi Nouman&quot;).</p>

of Evadne, the heroine, gives name to the play.&mdash;Beaumont and Fletcher,

<p>(Till the reign of Charles II., the kings of England claimed the feudal
right of disposing in marriage any one who owed them feudal allegiance.

<p><b>Amis the Priest</b>, the hero of a comic German epic of the 13th
century, represented as an Englishman, a man of great wit and humor, but
ignorant and hypocritical. His popularity excites the envy of the
superior clergy, who seek to depose him from the priesthood by making
public exposition of his ignorance, but by his quickness at repartee he
always manages to turn the laugh against them.&mdash;Ascribed to Stricker

<p><b>Ammo'nian Horn</b> (<i>The</i>), the cornucopia.
Ammon king of Lib'ya gave to his
mistress Amalthe'a (mother of Bacchus) a
tract of land resembling a ram's horn in
shape, and hence called the &quot;<i>Ammonian</i>
horn&quot; (from the giver), the &quot;<i>Amalthe'an</i>
horn&quot; (from the receiver), and the &quot;<i>Hesperian</i>
horn&quot; (from its locality). Amalthea

<p><b>Am'oret</b>, a modest, faithful shepherdess, who plighted her troth to
Per'igot (<i>t</i> sounded) at the &quot;Virtuous Well.&quot; The wanton shepherdess
Amarillis, having by enchantment assumed her appearance and dress, so
disgusted Perigot with her bold ways, that he lost his love for the true
Amoret, repulsed her with indignation, and tried to kill her. The
deception was revealed by Cor'in, &quot;the faithful shepherdess,&quot; and the
lovers being reconciled, were happily married.&mdash;John Fletcher, <i>The
Faithful Shepherdess</i> (before 1611).</p>

<p><b>Amoret'ta</b> or <b>Am'oret</b>, twin-born with Belphoeb&ecirc; (3 <i>syl</i>.),
their mother being Chrysog'on&ecirc; (4 <i>syl</i>.). While the mother and her two
babes were asleep, Diana took one (Belphoeb&ecirc;) to bring up, and Venus the
other. Venus committed Amoretta to the charge of Psych&ecirc; (2 <i>syl</i>.), and
Psych&ecirc; tended her as lovingly as she tended her own daughter Pleasure,
&quot;to whom she became the companion.&quot; When grown to marriageable estate,
Amoretta was brought to Fairyland, and wounded many a heart, but gave
her own only to sir Scudamore (bk. iii. 6). Being seized by Bu'sirane,
an enchanter, she was kept in durance by him because she would not &quot;her
true love deny;&quot; but Britomart delivered her and bound the enchanter
(bk. iii. 11, 12), after which she became the tender, loving wife of sir
Scudamore.</p>

<p><i>Amoret</i> is the type of female loveliness and wifely affection, soft,
warm, chaste, gentle, and ardent; not sensual nor yet platonic, but that
living, breathing, warm-hearted love which fits woman for the fond
mother and faithful wife.&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iii. (1590).</p>

<p><b>Amphitryon</b>, a Theban general, husband of Alcme'n&ecirc; (3 <i>syl.</i>). While
Amphitryon was absent at war with Pter'elas, king of the Tel'eboans,
Jupiter assumed his form, and visited Alcmen&ecirc;, who in due time became
the mother of Her'cul&ecirc;s. Next day Amphitryon returned, having slain
Pterelas, and Alcmen&ecirc; was surprised to see him so soon again. Here a
great entanglement arose, Alcmen&ecirc; telling her husband he visited her
last night, and showing him the ring he gave her, and Amphitryon
declaring he was with the army. This confusion is still further
increased by his slave Sos'ia, who went to take to Alcmen&ecirc; the news of
victory, but was stopped at the door of the house by Mercury, who had
assumed for the nonce Sosia's form, and the slave could not make out
whether he was himself or not. This plot has been made a comedy by
Plautus, Moli&egrave;re, and Dryden.</p>

<p><b>Androclus and the Lion.</b> Androclus was a runaway Roman slave, who
took refuge in a cavern. A lion entered, and instead of tearing him to
pieces, lifted up its fore-paw that Androclus might extract from it a
thorn. The fugitive, being subsequently captured, was doomed to fight
with a lion in the Roman arena, and it so happened that the very same
lion was let out against him; it instantly recognized its benefactor,
and began to fawn upon him with every token of gratitude and joy. The
story being told of this strange behavior, Androclus was forthwith set
free.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar anecdote is told of sir George Davis, English consul
at Florence at the beginning of the present century. One day he went to
see the lions of the great duke of Tuscany. There was one which the
keepers could not tame, but no sooner did sir George appear, than the
beast manifested every symptom of joy. Sir George entered the cage, when
the creature leaped on his shoulder, licked his face, wagged its tail,
and fawned like a dog. Sir George told the great duke that he had
brought up this lion, but as it grew older it became dangerous, and he
sold it to a Barbary captain. The duke said he bought it of the same
man, and the mystery was cleared up.</p>

arrived, and demanded that Astyanax should be given up and put to death,
lest in manhood he should attempt to avenge his father's death. Pyrrhus
told Andromach&ecirc; that he would protect her son in defiance of all Greece
if she would become his wife, and she reluctantly consented thereto.
While the marriage ceremonies were going on, the ambassadors rushed on
Pyrrhus and slew him, but as he fell he placed the crown on the head of

and Mde. Sotenville, his wife's parents. The baron with George Dandin
call on the lover, who denies the accusation, and George Dandin has to
beg pardon. Subsequently, he catches his wife and Clitandre together,
and sends at once for M. and Mde. Sotenville; but Angelique, aware of
their presence, pretends to denounce her lover, and even takes up a
stick to beat him for the &quot;insult offered to a virtuous wife;&quot; so again
the parents declare their daughter to be the very paragon of women.
Lastly, George Dandin detects his wife and Clitandre together at
night-time, and succeeds in shutting his wife out of her room; but
Angelique now pretends to kill herself, and when George goes for a light
to look for the body, she rushes into her room and shuts him out. At

great civic banquet given by the doge, was kicked out of the house by
order of the doge, and in revenge wrote some scurrilous lines against
the dogaressa. This insult was referred to &quot;The Forty,&quot; and Steno was
sentenced to two months' imprisonment, which the doge considered a very
inadequate punishment for the offence.&mdash;Byron, <i>Marino Faliero</i>.</p>

The character of the calm, pure-spirited Angiolina<br>
is developed most admirably. The great<br>
difference between her temper and that of her<br>
fiery husband is vividly portrayed, but not less<br>
vividly touched is that strong bond of union<br>
which exists in the common nobleness of their<br>
deep natures. There is no spark of jealousy in<br>
the old man's thoughts. He does not expect the<br>
fervor of youthful passion in his young wife;<br>
but he finds what is far better&mdash;the fearless confidence<br>
of one so innocent that she can scarcely<br>
believe in the existence of guilt.... She thinks<br>
Steno's greatest punishment will be &quot;the blushes<br>
of his privacy.&quot;&mdash;Lockhart.<br>

<p><b>Anthonio,</b> &quot;the merchant of Venice,&quot; in Shakespeare's drama so
called (1598). Anthonio borrows of Shylock, a Jew, 3000 ducats for three
months, to lend to his friend Bassanio. The conditions of the loan were
these: if the money was paid within the time, only the principal should
be returned; but if not, the Jew should be allowed to cut from
Anthonio's body &quot;a pound of flesh.&quot; As the ships of Anthonio were
delayed by contrary winds, he was unable to pay within the three months,
and Shylock demanded the forfeiture according to the bond. Portia, in
the dress of a law-doctor, conducted the case, and when the Jew was
about to cut the flesh, stopped him, saying&mdash;(1) the bond gave him no
drop of blood; and (2) he must take neither more nor less than an exact
pound. If he shed one drop of blood or if he cut more or less than an
exact pound, his life would be forfeit. As it was quite impossible to
comply with these restrictions, the Jew was nonsuited, and had to pay a
heavy fine for seeking the life of a citizen.</p>

Jesus, which would break the spell, and then the devil would have tossed
his unwelcome burden into the sea, but the bishop only cried, &quot;Gee up,

were &quot;the glowing modesty of her countenance, her silent diffidence, and

useful and elegant employment; her diligence in household affairs, her
contempt of finery in dress, and her ignorance of her own beauty,&quot;

and, being picked up by different cruisers, one was carried to Syracuse,

and, being fortunate enough to save the duke's life, became a great man
and married well. The Syracusian Antipholus, going in search of his
brother, came to Ephesus, where a series of blunders occurs from the
wonderful likeness of the two brothers and their two servants called
Dromio. The confusion becomes so great that the Ephesian is taken up as
a madman. It so happened that both brothers appeared before the duke at
the same time; and the extraordinary likeness being seen by all, the
cause of the blunders was evident, and everything was satisfactorily
explained.&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Comedy of Errors</i> (1593).</p>

Ector and his lady, whose son, sir Key, is over and over again called
the prince's foster-brother. The <i>History</i> furthermore states that
Arthur made sir Key his seneschal <i>because</i> he was his foster-brother.</p>

So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and he<br>

<p><b>Arc</b> <i>(Joan of)</i>, or <i>Jeanne la Pucelle</i>, the &quot;Maid of Orleans,&quot;
daughter of a rustic of Domr&eacute;my, near Vaucouleurs, in France. She was
servant at an inn when she conceived the idea of liberating France from
the English. Having gained admission to Charles VII., she was sent by
him to raise the siege of Orleans, and actually succeeded in so doing.
Schiller has a tragedy on the subject, Casimir Delavigne an elegy on
her, Southey an epic poem on her life and death, and Voltaire a
burlesque.</p>

<p>In regard to her death, M. Octave Delepi&egrave;re, in his <i>Doute Historique</i>,
denies the tradition of her having been burnt to death at Rouen; and
Vignier discovered in a family muniment chest the &quot;contract of marriage
between&quot; Robert des Armoise, knight, and Jeanne d'Arc, surnamed &quot;The
Maid of Orleans.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ar'cades Ambo</b>, both fools alike; both &quot;sweet innocents;&quot; both alike
eccentric. There is nothing in the character of Corydon and Thyrsis
(Virgil's <i>Eclogue</i>, vii. 4) to justify this disparaging application of
the phrase. All Virgil says is they were both &quot;in the flower of their
youth,&quot; and both Arcadians, both equal in setting a theme for song or
capping it epigrammatically; but as Arcadia was the least intellectual
part of Greece, an &quot;Arcadian&quot; came to signify a dunce, and hence
&quot;Arcades ambo&quot; received its present acceptation.</p>

<p><b>Archbsh'op of Grana'da</b> told his secretary, Gil Blas, when he hired
him,</p>

<p>&quot;Whenever thou shalt perceive my pen smack of old age and my genius
flag, don't fail to advertise me of it, for I don't trust to my own
judgment, which may be seduced by self-love.&quot; After a fit of apoplexy,
Gil Blas ventured in the most delicate manner to hint to his grace that
&quot;his last discourse had not altogether the energy of his former ones.&quot;
To this the archbishop replied, &quot;You are yet too raw to make proper
distinctions. Know, child, that I never composed a better homily than
that which you disapprove. Go, tell my treasurer to give you 100 ducats.
Adieu, Mr. Gil Blas; I wish you all manner of prosperity, with a little
more taste.&quot;&mdash;Le-sage, <i>Gil Blas</i>, vii. 3 (1715).</p>

of lies and all deception. Assuming the guise of the Red Cross Knight,
he deceived Una; and under the guise of a hermit, he deceived the knight
himself. Archimago is introduced in bks. i. and ii. of Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry
Queen.</i> The poet says:</p>

<p><b>Ar'chy M'Sar'casm</b> <i>(Sir)</i>, &quot;a proud Caledonian knight, whose
tongue, like the dart of death, spares neither sex nor age ... His
insolence of family and licentiousness of wit gained him the contempt of
every one&quot; (i. 1). Sir Archy tells Charlotte, &quot;In the house of M'Sarcasm
are two barons, three viscounts, six earls, one marquisate, and two
dukes, besides baronets and lairds oot o' a' reckoning&quot; (i. 1). He makes
love to Charlotte Goodchild, but supposing it to be true that she has
lost her fortune, declares to her that he has just received letters
&quot;frae the dukes, the marquis, and a' the dignitaries of the family ...
expressly prohibiting his contaminating the blood of M'Sarcasm wi'
onything sprung from a hogshead or a coonting-house&quot; (ii. 1).</p>

<p>The man has something droll, something ridiculous in him. His abominable
Scotch accent, his grotesque visage almost buried in snuff, the roll of
his eyes and twist of his mouth, his strange inhuman laugh, his
tremendous periwig, and his manners altogether&mdash;why, one might take him
for a mountebank doctor at a Dutch fair.&mdash;C. Macklin, <i>Love &agrave;-la-mode</i>,
i. 1 (1779).</p>

<p><i>Sir Archy's Great-grandmother.</i> Sir Archy M'Sarcasm insisted on
fighting Sir Callaghan O'Brallaghan on a point of ancestry. The
Scotchman said that the Irish are a colony from Scotland, &quot;an ootcast, a
mere ootcast.&quot; The Irishman retorted by saying that &quot;one Mac Fergus
O'Brallaghan went from Carrickfergus, and peopled all Scotland with his
own hands.&quot; Charlotte [Goodchild] interposed, and asked the cause of the
contention, whereupon Sir Callaghan replied, &quot;Madam, it is about sir
Archy's great-grandmother.&quot;&mdash;C. Macklin, <i>Love &agrave;-la-mode</i>, i. I (1779).</p>

<p><b>Archy'tas</b> of Tarentum made a wooden pigeon that could fly; and

<p><b>Ar'cite</b> (2 <i>syl</i>.) <b>and Pal'amon,</b> two Theban knights, captives
of duke Theseus, who used to see from their dungeon window the duke's
sister-in-law, Emily, taking her airing in the palace garden, and fell
in love with her. Both captives having gained their liberty, contended
for the lady by single combat. Arcite was victor, but being thrown from
his horse was killed, and Emily became the bride of Palamon.&mdash;Chaucer,

<p>Richard Edwards in 1566 produced a drama entitled <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ar'den</b> <i>(Enoch)</i>, the hero of a poetic tale by Tennyson. He is a
seaman wrecked on a desert island, who returns home after the absence of
several years, and finds his wife married to another. Seeing her both
happy and prosperous, Enoch resolves not to mar her domestic peace, so
leaves her undisturbed, and dies of a broken heart.</p>

<p><b>Ar'den of Fev'ersliam,</b> a noble character, honorable, forgiving,
affectionate, and modest. His wife Alicia in her sleep reveals to him
her guilty love for Mosby, but he pardons her on condition that she will
never see the seducer again. Scarcely has she made the promise when she
plots with Mosby her husband's murder. In a planned street-scuffle,
Mosby pretends to take Arden's part, and thus throws him off his guard.
Arden thinks he has wronged him, and invites him to his house, but Mosby
conspires with two hired ruffians to fall on his host during a game of
draughts, the right moment being signified by Mosby's saying, &quot;Now I
take you.&quot; Arden is murdered; but the whole gang is apprehended and
brought to justice.</p>

<p>(This drama is based on a murder which took place in 1551. Ludwig Tieck
has translated the play into German, as a genuine production of
Shakespeare. Some ascribe the play to George Lillo, but Charles Lamb
gives 1592 as the date of its production, and says the author is
unknown.)</p>

introduced taxing his apothecary's bills, under the conviction that he
cannot afford to be sick at the prices charged, but then he notices that
he has already reduced his bills during the current month, and is not so
well. He first hits upon the plan of marrying Angelique to a young
doctor, but to this the lady objects. His brother suggests that Argan
himself should be his own doctor, and when the invalid replies he has
not studied either diseases, drugs, or Latin, the objection is overruled
by investing the &quot;malade&quot; in a doctor's cap and robe. The piece
concludes with the ceremonial in macaronic Latin.</p>

is the subject of bk. iii. of the <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>; and the achievements of
sir Artegal, as the impersonation of justice, is the subject of bk. v.</p>

<p>Sir Artegal's first exploit was to decide to which claimant a living
woman belonged. This he decided according to Solomon's famous judgment
respecting &quot;the living and dead child&quot; (canto 1). His next was to
destroy the corrupt practice of bribery and toll (canto 2). His third
was the exposing of Braggadoccio and his follower Trompart (canto 3). He
had then to decide to which brother a chest of money found at sea
belonged, whether to Bracidas or Am'idas; he gave judgment in favor of
the former (canto 4). He then fell into the hands of Rad'igund queen of
the Amazons, and was released by Britomart (cantos 5 and 6), who killed
Radigund (canto 7). His last and greatest achievement was the
deliverance of Ire'na <i>(Ireland)</i> from Grantorto <i>(rebellion)</i>, whom he
slew (canto 12).</p>

<p>(The old Arthurian Romances have been collated and rendered into English
by sir Thomas Malory, in three parts. Part i. contains the early history
of Arthur and the beautiful allegory of Gareth and Linet; part ii.
contains the adventures of sir Tristram; and part iii. the adventures of
sir Launcelot, with the death of Arthur and his knights. Sir Frederick
Madden and J.T.K. have also contributed to the same series of legends.)</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg"><i>Sources of the Arthurian Romances</i>. The prose series of
romances called Arthurian, owe their origin to: 1. The legendary
chronicles composed in Wales or Brittany, such as <i>De Excidio
Britanniae</i> of Gildas. 2. The chronicles of Nennius (ninth century). 3.
The Armoric collections of Walter [Cale'nius] or Gauliter, archdeacon of
Oxford. 4. The <i>Chronicon sive Historia Britonum</i> of Geoffrey of
Monmouth. 5. Floating traditions and metrical ballads and romances. (See
CHARLEMAGNE.)</p>

Arturo has to aid Enrichetta (<i>Henrietta, widow of Charles I.</i>) in her
escape, and Elvira, supposing he is eloping with a rival, temporarily
loses her reason. On his return, Arturo explains the circumstances, and
they vow never more to part. At this juncture Arturo is arrested for
treason, and led away to execution; but a herald announces the defeat of

<p><b>Ar'valan</b>, the wicked son of Keha'ma, slain by Ladur'lad for
attempting to dishonor his daughter Kail'yal (2 <i>syl.</i>). After this, his
spirit became the relentless persecutor of the holy maiden, but holiness
and chastity triumphed over sin and lust. Thus when Kailyal was taken to
the bower of bliss in paradise, Arvalan borrowed the dragon-car of the
witch Lor'rimite (3 <i>syl.</i>) to carry her off; but when the dragons came
in sight of the holy place they were unable to mount, and went
perpetually downwards, till Arvalan was dropped into an ice-rift of
perpetual snow. When he presented himself before her in the temple of
Jaganaut, she set fire to the pagoda. And when he caught the maiden
waiting for her father, who was gone to release the glendoveer from the
submerged city of Baly, Baly himself came to her rescue.</p>

&quot;Help, help, Kehama! help!&quot; he cried.<br>

of Scandinavia. Christian employs the prince to entrap Gustavus, but
when he approaches him the better instincts of old friendship and the
nobleness of Gustavus prevail, so that Arvida not only refuses to betray
his friend, but even abandons to him all further rivalry in the love of
Christina.&mdash;H. Brooke, <i>Gustavus Vasa</i> (1730).</p>

till the rocks that beset the coast were removed, &quot;and there n'is no
stone y-seen.&quot; By the aid of magic, Aurelius caused all the rocks of the
coast to disappear, and Dorigen's husband insisted that she should keep
her word. When Aurelius saw how sad she was, and was told that she had
come in obedience to her husband's wishes, he said he would rather die
than injure so true a wife and noble a gentleman.&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Canterbury

brother of Guide'rius. The two in early childhood were kidnapped by
Bela'rius, out of revenge for being unjustly banished, and were brought
up by him in a cave. When they were grown to manhood, Belarius, having
rescued the king from the Romans, was restored to favor. He then
introduced the two young men to Cymbeline, and told their story, upon
which the king was rejoiced to find that his two sons whom he thought
dead were both living.&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Cymbeline</i> (1605).</p>

<p><b>As You Like It</b>, a comedy by Shakespeare. One of the French dukes,
being driven from his dukedom by his brother, went with certain
followers to the forest of Arden, where they lived a free and easy life,
chiefly occupied in the chase. The deposed duke had one daughter, named
Rosalind, whom the usurper kept at court as the companion of his own
daughter Celia, and the two cousins were very fond of each other. At a
wrestling match Rosalind fell in love with Orlando, who threw his
antagonist, a giant and professional athlete. The usurping duke
(Frederick) now banished her from the court, but her cousin Celia
resolved to go to Arden with her; so Rosalind in boy's clothes (under
the name of Ganymede), and Celia as a rustic maiden (under the name of
Alie'na), started to find the deposed duke. Orlando being driven from
home by his elder brother, also went to the forest of Arden, and was
taken under the duke's protection. Here he met the ladies, and a double
marriage was the result&mdash;Orlando married Rosalind, and his elder brother
Oliver married Celia. The usurper retired to a religious house, and the
deposed duke was restored to his dominions.&mdash;(1598.)</p>

two mothers conceived a base passion for the other's son, and when the
young men repulsed their advances, accused them to their father of gross
designs upon their honor. Camaralzaman commanded his vizier to put them
both to death; but instead of doing so, he conducted them out of the
city, and told them not to return to their father's kingdom (the island
of Ebony). They wandered on for ten days, when Assad went to a city in
sight to obtain provisions. Here he was entrapped by an old
fire-worshipper, who offered him hospitality, but cast him into a
dungeon, intending to offer him up a human victim on the &quot;mountain of
fire.&quot; The ship in which he was sent being driven on the coast of queen
Margiana, Assad was sold to her as a slave, but being recaptured was
carried back to his old dungeon. Here Bosta'na, one of the old man's
daughters, took pity on him, and released him, and ere long Assad
married queen Margiana, while Amgiad, out of gratitude, married
Bostana.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights</i> (&quot;Amgiad and Assad&quot;).</p>

<p>We think of Astarte as young, beautiful, innocent,&mdash;guilty, lost,
murdered, judged, pardoned; but still, in her permitted visit to earth,
speaking in a voice of sorrow, and with a countenance yet pale with
mortal trouble. We had but a glimpse of her in her beauty and innocence,
but at last she rises before us in all the moral silence of a ghost,
with fixed, glazed, and passionless eyes, revealing death, judgment, and
eternity.&mdash;Professor Wilson.</p>

handsome. Astolpho was carried to Alci'na's isle on the back of a whale;
and when Alcina tired of him, she changed him into a myrtle tree, but
Melissa disenchanted him. Astolpho descended into the infernal regions;

<p>&quot;I have possessed,&quot; said he to Imlac, &quot;for five years the regulation of
the weather, and the distribution of the seasons: the sun has listened
to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction; the

of Apollo. When Lyrnessus was taken, Astynom&ecirc; fell to the share of
Agamemnon, but the father begged to be allowed to ransom her. Agamemnon
refused to comply, whereupon the priest invoked the anger of his patron
god, and Apollo sent a plague into the Grecian camp. This was the cause
of contention between Agamemnon and Achill&ecirc;s, and forms the subject of
Homer's epic called <i>The Iliad</i>.</p>

<p><b>As'wad,</b> son of Shedad king of Ad. He was saved alive when the angel
of death destroyed Shedad and all his subjects, because he showed mercy
to a camel which had been bound to a tomb to starve to death, that it
might serve its master on the day of resurrection.&mdash;Southey, <i>Thalaba

<p><b>At'ala,</b> the name of a novel by Fran&ccedil;ois Auguste Chateaubriand.
Atala, the daughter of a white man and a Christianized Indian, takes an
oath of virginity, but subsequently falling in love with Chactas, a
young Indian, she poisons herself for fear that she may be tempted to
break her oath. The novel was received with extraordinary enthusiasm
(1801).</p>

<p>(This has nothing to do with <i>Attila</i>, king of the Huns, nor with
<i>Atlialie</i> (queen of Judah), the subject of Racine's great tragedy.)</p>

<p><b>Atalanta</b>, of Arcadia, wished to remain single, and therefore gave
out that she would marry no one who could not outstrip her in running;
but if any challenged her and lost the race, he was to lose his life.
Hippom'en&ecirc;s won the race by throwing down golden apples, which Atalanta
kept stopping to pick up. William Morris has chosen this for one of his
tales in <i>Earthly Paradise</i> (March).</p>

<p>In short, she thus appeared like another Atalanta.&mdash;Comtesse D'Aunoy,

Duessa. She squinted, lied with a false tongue, and maligned even the
best of beings. Her abode, &quot;far under ground hard by the gates of hell,&quot;
is described at length in bk. iv. I. When Sir Blandamour was challenged
by Braggadoccio (canto 4), the terms of the contest were that the
conqueror should have &quot;Florimel,&quot; and the other &quot;the old hag At&ecirc;,&quot; who
was always to ride beside him till he could pass her off to
another.&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iv. (1596).</p>

<p><b>Ath'alie</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, and wife of

Athalie, attracted by the shouts, went to the temple, and was killed by
the mob. This forms the subject and title of Racine's <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>
(1691), and was Mdlle. Rachel's great part.</p>

<p><i>Augusta</i>, a title conferred by the Roman emperors on their wives,
sisters, daughters, mothers, and even concubines. It had to be
conferred; for even the wife of an Augustus was not an Augusta until
after her coronation.</p>

<p>1. EMPRESSES. Livia and Julia were both <i>Augusta</i>; so were Julia (wife
of Tiberius), Messalina, Agrippina, Octavia, Poppaea, Statilia, Sabina,
Domitilla, Domitia, and Faustina. In imperials the wife of an emperor is
spoken of as <i>Augusta: Serenissima Augusta conjux nostra; Divina
Augusta</i>, etc. But the title had to be conferred; hence we read,
&quot;Domitian uxorem suam <i>Augustam</i> jussit nuncupari;&quot; and &quot;Flavia Titiana,
eadem die, uxor ejus [<i>i.e.</i> Pertinax] <i>Augusta</i> est appellata.&quot;</p>

<p>2. MOTHERS or GRANDMOTHERS. Antonia, grandmother of Caligula, was
created <i>Augusta</i>. Claudius made his mother Antonia <i>Augusta</i> after her
death. Heliogab&acute;alus had coins inscribed with &quot;Julia M&aelig;sa <i>Augusta</i>,&quot; in
honor of his grandmother;</p>

<p>Mammaea, mother of Alexander Severus, is styled <i>Augusta</i> on coins;
and so is Helena, mother of Constantine.</p>

<p>3. SISTERS. Honorius speaks of his sister as &quot;venerabilis <i>Augusta</i>
germananostra.&quot; Trajan has coins inscribed with &quot;Diva Marciana
<i>Augusta</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>4. DAUGHTERS. Mallia Scantilla the wife, and Didia the daughter of
Didius Julianus, were both <i>Augusta</i>. Titus inscribed on coins his
daughter as &quot;Julia Sabina <i>Augusta</i>;&quot; there are coins of the emperor
Decius inscribed with &quot;Herennia Etruscilla <i>Augusta</i>,&quot; and &quot;Sallustia
<i>Augusta</i>,&quot; sisters of the emperor Decius.</p>

her lover being shot, she mounted the battery in his place. The French,
after a siege of two months, were obliged to retreat, August 15, 1808.</p>

Such were the exploits of the Maid of Saragossa,<br>

Cl&eacute;ante gets possession of a casket of gold belonging to the miser, and
hidden in the garden. When Harpagon discovers his loss he raves like a
madman, and Cl&eacute;ante gives him the choice of Mariane or the casket. The
miser chooses the casket, and leaves the young lady to his son. The
second plot is connected with Elise (2 <i>syl.</i>), the miser's daughter,
promised in marriage by the father to his friend Anselme (2 <i>syl.</i>); but
Elise is herself in love with Val&egrave;re, who, however, turns out to be the

happened to enter the cobbler's stall, and falling into a gossip heard
about the body which the cobbler had sewed together. Mustapha pointed
out to him the house of Cassim Baba's widow, and the thief marked it
with a piece of white chalk. Next day the cobbler pointed out the house

O'er which the white-winged angels go,<br>
Bearing the holy dead to heaven.<br>

with him, and exchanged rings. Next day she inquired for the prince, but
her inquiry was thought so absurd that she was confined as a madwoman.
At length her foster-brother solved the difficulty thus: The emperor
having proclaimed that whoever cured the princess of her [supposed]
madness should have her for his wife, he sent Camaralzaman to play the
magician, and imparted the secret to the princess by sending her the
ring she had left with the sleeping prince. The cure was instantly
effected, and the marriage solemnized with due pomp. When the emperor

&quot;Like a dog,&quot; he cried. &quot;I would have made you my footstool when I
mounted my saddle, and when your services were not needed would have
chained you in a cage like a wild beast.&quot; Tamerlane replied, &quot;Then to
show you the difference of my spirit, I shall treat you as a king.&quot; So
saying, he ordered his chains to be struck off, gave him one of the
royal tents, and promised to restore him to his throne if he would lay
aside his hostility. Bajazet abused this noble generosity; plotted the
assassination of Tamerlane; and bow-strung Mone&acute;ses. Finding clemency of
no use, Tamerlane commanded him to be used &quot;as a dog, and to be chained

a castle where the custom was for every guest to joust. He was

fierce was the encounter that both the combatants were slain, but Balin
lived just long enough to learn that his antagonist was his dearly
beloved brother Balan, and both were buried in one tomb.&mdash;Sir T. Malory,

<p><b>Baly,</b> one of the ancient and gigantic kings of India, who founded
the city called by his name. He redressed wrongs, upheld justice, was
generous and truthful, compassionate and charitable, so that at death he
became one of the judges of hell. His city in time got overwhelmed with
the encroaching ocean, but its walls were not overthrown, nor were the
rooms encumbered with the weeds and alluvial of the sea. One day a
dwarf, named Vamen, asked the mighty monarch to allow him to measure
three of his own paces for a hut to dwell in. Baly smiled, and bade him
measure out what he required. The first pace of the dwarf compassed the
whole earth, the second the whole heavens, and the third the infernal
regions. Baly at once perceived that the dwarf was Vishn&ucirc;, and adored
the present deity. Vishn&ucirc; made the king &quot;Governor of Pad&acute;alon&quot; or hell,
and permitted him once a year to revisit the earth, on the first full
moon of November.</p>

Baly built<br>
A city, like the cities of the gods,<br>
Being like a god himself. For many an age<br>
Hath ocean warred against his palaces,<br>
Till overwhelmed they lie beneath the waves,<br>
Not overthrown.<br>

sheriff of Shropshire, and he was conveyed to Salisbury, where he was
beheaded. The ghost of the duke prayed that Banastar's eldest son, &quot;reft
of his wits might end his life in a pigstye;&quot; that his second son might
&quot;be drowned in a dyke&quot; containing less than &quot;half a foot of water;&quot; that

hauled him, and burnt him like a martyr, but he survived the burning.
They crushed him between two stones, but killed him not. Sir John bore
no malice for this ill-usage, but did his best to cheer the flagging
spirits even of his worst persecutors.</p>

<p>His name was Beaton&mdash;Angus Beaton. His father was a Scotchman, but
Beaton was born in Syracuse, New York, and it had taken only three years
to obliterate many traces of native and ancestral manner in him. He wore
his thick beard cut shorter than his moustache, and a little pointed; he
stood with his shoulders well thrown back, and with a lateral curve of
his person when he talked about art which would alone have carried
conviction, even if he had not had a thick, dark bang coming almost to
the brows of his mobile gray eyes, and had not spoken English with
quick, staccato impulses, so as to give it the effect of epigrammatic
and sententious French.</p>

wayward, though volatile she is not unfeeling, though teeming with wit
and gaiety she is affectionate and energetic. At first she dislikes
Benedick, and thinks him a flippant conceited coxcomb; but overhearing a
conversation between her cousin Hero and her gentlewoman, in which Hero
bewails that Beatrice should trifle with such deep love as that of
Benedick, and should scorn so true and good a gentleman, she cries,
&quot;Sits the wind thus? then, farewell, contempt. Benedick, love on; I will
requite you.&quot; This conversation of Hero's was a mere ruse, but Benedick
had been caught by a similar trick played by Claudio, don Pedro, and
Leonato. The result was they sincerely loved each other, and were

Sir Fine-face, sir Fair-hands? But see thou to it<br>
That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day,<br>

<p>Be it remembered that Key himself called Gareth &quot;Beaumain&quot; from the
extraordinary size of the lad's hands; but the taunt put into the mouth
of Key by the poet indicates that the lad prided himself on his &quot;fine&quot;
face and &quot;fair&quot; hands, which is not the case. If &quot;fair hands&quot; is a
translation of this nickname, it should be &quot;fine hands,&quot; which bears the

hobby is tending the sick and playing the leech, she orders him to be
removed to her mansion. Here he and Dorinda (daughter of lady Bountiful)
fall in love with each other, and finally marry. Archer falls in love
with Mrs. Sullen, the wife of squire Sullen, who had been married
fourteen months but agreed to a divorce on the score of incompatibility
of tastes and temper. This marriage forms no part of the play; all we
are told is that she returns to the roof of her brother, sir Charles

years old his father died, and the sultan, angry with him for keeping
from court, confiscated all his goods, and would have seized Bedredeen
if he had not made his escape. During sleep he was conveyed by fairies
to Cairo, and substituted for an ugly groom (Hunchback) to whom his
cousin, the Queen of Beauty, was to have been married. Next day he was
carried off by the same means to Damascus, where he lived for ten years
as a pastry-cook. Search was made for him, and the search party, halting
outside the city of Damascus, sent for some cheese-cakes. When the
cheese-cakes arrived, the widow of Nouredeen declared that they must
have been made by her son, for no one else knew the secret of making
them, and that she herself had taught it to him. On hearing this, the
vizier ordered Bedredeen to be seized, &quot;for making cheese-cakes without
pepper,&quot; and the joke was carried on till the party arrived at Cairo,
when the pastry-cook prince was reunited to his wife, the Queen of

too busy with house affairs to take heed of the Magi when they went to
offer their gifts, and said she would stop for their return; but they
returned by another way, and Befana every Twelfth Night watches to see

poor blind father, the beggar of Bethnal Green, and all slunk off except
the knight, who went and asked leave to marry &quot;the pretty Bessee.&quot; The

to the ship. The queen next day gave the ship chase. Assad was thrown
overboard, and swam to the city whence he started. Behram also was
drifted to the same place. Here the captain fell in with the prince, and
reconducted him to the original dungeon. Bosta'na, a daughter of the old
fire-worshipper, taking pity on the prince, released him; and, at the
end, Assad married queen Margiana, Bostana married prince Amgiad

princes were grown to manhood, a battle was fought between the Romans
and Britons, in which Cymbeline was made prisoner, but Belarius coming
to the rescue, the king was liberated and the Roman general in turn was

On the death of old Belcour, the young man came to England as the guest
of his unknown father, fell in love with Miss Dudley, and married her.

<p><b>Belial</b>, sons of, in the Bible <i>passim</i> means the lewd and
profligate. Milton has created the personality of Belial:</p>

Belial came last; than whom a spirit more lewd<br>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood<br>
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he<br>
In temples, and at altars, when the priest<br>
Tarns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled<br>
With lust and violence the house of God?<br>
In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br>
And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br>
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers<br>
And injury and outrage; and when night<br>
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br>
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br>

<p>Milton, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, i. 490</p>

On the other side up rose<br>
Belial, in act more graceful and humane;<br>
A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed<br>
For dignity composed, and high exploit.<br>
But all was false and hollow; though his tongue.<br>
Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear<br>
The better reason, to perplex and dash<br>
Maturest counsels; for his thoughts were low<br>
To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds<br>
Timorous and slothful.<br>

<p><i>Belin'da</i>, the heroine of Pope's <i>Rape of the Lock</i>. This mock heroic
is founded on the following incident:&mdash;Lord Petre cut a lock of hair
from the head of Miss Arabella Fermor, and the young lady resented the
liberty as an unpardonable affront. The poet says Belinda wore on her
neck two curls, one of which the baron cut off with a pair of scissors
borrowed of Clarissa, and when Belinda angrily demanded that it should
be delivered up, it had flown to the skies and become a meteor there.

Belinda was very handsome, very independent, most irreproachable, and
devotedly attached to Beverley. When he hinted suspicions of infidelity,
she was too proud to deny their truth, but her pure and ardent love
instantly rebuked her for giving her lover causeless pain.&mdash;A. Murphy,

Argan devotedly, humors him in all his whims, calls him &quot;mon fils,&quot; and
makes him believe that if he were to die it would be the death of her.
Toinette induces Argan to put these specious protestations to the test
by pretending to be dead. He does so, and when Beline enters the room,
instead of deploring her loss, she cries in ecstasy:</p>

words, &quot;<i>Give an obolus to poor old Belisarius</i>.&quot; Marmontel has written

was married, but the other two were not. When William was captured at
Carlisle, and was led to execution, Adam and Clym rescued him, and all
three went to London to crave pardon of the king, which, at the queen's
intercession, was granted them. They then showed the king specimens of
their skill in archery, and the king was so well pleased that he made
William a &quot;gentleman of fe,&quot; and the two others yeomen of the

built for themselves a bower in a very romantic spot called Burn Braes,
to which they retired, and were supplied with food, etc., by a young man
who was in love with both of them. The young man caught the plague,
communicated it to the two young ladies, and all three died.&mdash;Allan

<p>The mice, being much annoyed by the persecutions of a cat, resolved that
a bell should be hung about her neck to give notice of her approach. The
measure was agreed to in full council, but one of the sager mice
inquired, &quot;Who would undertake to bell the cat?&quot; When Lauder told this
fable to a council of Scotch nobles, met to declaim against one Cochran,
Archibald Douglas started up and exclaimed in thunder, &quot;I will;&quot; and
hence the sobriquet referred to.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>Tales of a

father of Antea, with sealed tablets, asking that the bearer might be
put to death. Iobates sent the youth on dangerous errands, but he came
off unharmed from all. Among other exploits he killed the Chim&aelig;ra and
slew the Amazons. Later, he tried to mount to Olympus on the winged
horse Pegasus, but he fell and wandered about in melancholy madness on
the Aleian field until he died. This peculiar form of madness is called
<i>morbus Bellerophonteus</i>. Homer tells the story of Bellerophon in the
Iliad, Book VI. Milton alludes to him, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, VII. 15-20.
Hawthorne has told the story of the Chim&aelig;ra in <i>A Wonder Book.</i></p>

<p><b>Belle's Stratagem</b> (<i>The</i>). The &quot;belle&quot; is Letitia Hardy, and her
stratagem was for the sake of winning the love of Doricourt, to whom she
had been betrothed. The very fact of being betrothed to Letitia sets
Doricourt against her, so she goes unknown to him to a masquerade, where
Doricourt falls in love with &quot;the beautiful stranger.&quot; In order to
accomplish the marriage of his daughter, Mr. Hardy pretends to be &quot;sick
unto death,&quot; and beseeches Doricourt to wed Letitia before he dies.
Letitia meets her betrothed in her masquerade dress, and unbounded is
the joy of the young man to find that &quot;the beautiful stranger&quot; is the
lady to whom he has been betrothed.&mdash;Mrs. Cowley, <i>The Belle's
Stratagem</i> (1780).</p>

<p><b>Belle the Giant.</b> It is said that the giant Belle mounted on his

<p><b>Bellicent</b>, daughter of Gorlo&iuml;s lord of Tintag'il and his wife
Ygern&ecirc; or Igerna. As the widow married Uther the pen-dragon, and was
then the mother of king Arthur, it follows that Bellicent was half-sister
of Arthur. Tennyson in <i>Gareth and Lynette</i> says that Bellicent
was the wife of Lot king of Orkney, and mother of Gaw'ain and Mordred,
but this is not in accordance either with the chronicle or the history,
for Geoffrey in his <i>Chronicle</i> says that Lot's wife was Anne, the
sister (not half-sister) of Arthur (viii. 20, 21), and sir T. Malory, in
his <i>History of Prince Arthur</i> says:</p>

<p><b>Bertulphe</b> (2 <i>syl</i>.), provost of Bruges, the son of a serf. By his
genius and energy he became the richest, most honored, and most powerful
man in Bruges. His arm was strong in fight, his wisdom swayed the
council, his step was proud, and his eye untamed. He had one child, most
dearly beloved, the bride of sir Bouchard, a knight of noble descent.
Charles &quot;the Good,&quot; earl of Flanders, made a law (1127) that whoever
married a serf should become a serf, and that serfs were serfs till
manumission. By these absurd decrees Bertulphe the provost, his daughter
Constance, and his knightly son-in-law were all serfs. The result was
that the provost slew the earl and then himself, his daughter went mad
and died, and Bouchard was slain in fight.&mdash;S. Knowles, <i>The Provost of

Saber only left him on a desert land as a waif, and he was brought up as
a shepherd. Hearing that his mother had married Mor'dure (2 <i>syl</i>.), the

Mordure; but Mordure slipped aside, and escaped the blow. Bevis was now
sent out of the country, and being sold to an Armenian, was presented to
the king. Jos'ian, the king's daughter, fell in love with him; they were
duly married, and Bevis was knighted. Having slain the boar which made
holes in the earth as big as that into which Curtius leapt, he was
appointed general of the Armenian forces, subdued Brandamond of
Damascus, and made Damascus tributary to Armenia. Being sent, on a
future occasion, as ambassador to Damascus, he was thrust into a prison,
where were two huge serpents; these he slew, and then effected his
escape. His next encounter was with Ascupart the giant, whom he made his
slave. Lastly, he slew the great dragon of Colein, and then returned to

she casts down a rope-ladder for the duke to climb up by. Bireno has
Alinda murdered to prevent the deception being known, and accuses the
princess of unchastity&mdash;a crime in Lombardy punished by death. As the
princess is led to execution, Paladore challenges the duke, and kills
him. The villainy is fully revealed, and the princess is married to the
man of her choice, who had twice saved her life.&mdash;Robert Jephson, <i>The

<p><b>Biron</b>, a merry mad-cap young lord, in attendance on Ferdinand king
of Navarre. Biron promises to spend three years with the king in study,
during which time no woman is to approach his court; but no sooner has
he signed the compact, than he falls in love with Rosaline. Rosaline
defers his suit for twelve months and a day, saying, &quot;If you my favor
mean to get, for twelve months seek the weary beds of people sick.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Biron</i> (<i>Charles de Gontaut due de</i>), greatly beloved by Henri IV. of
France. He won immortal laurels at the battles of Arques and Ivry, and
at the sieges of Paris and Rouen. The king loaded him with honors: he
was admiral of France, marshal, governor of Bourgoyne, duke and peer of
France. This too-much honor made him forget himself, and he entered into
a league with Spain and Savoy against his country. The plot was
discovered by Lafin; and although Henri wished to pardon him, he was
executed (1602, aged 40).</p>

<p>George Chapman has made him the subject of two tragedies, entitled
<i>Biron's Conspiracy</i> and <i>Biron's Tragedy</i> (1557-1634).</p>

<p><i>Biron</i>, eldest son of count Baldwin, who disinherited him for marrying
Isabella, a nun. Biron now entered the army and was sent to the siege of
Candy, where he fell, and it was supposed died. After the lapse of seven
years, Isabella, reduced to abject poverty, married Villeroy (2 <i>syl</i>.),
but the day after her espousals Biron returned, whereupon Isabella went
mad and killed herself.&mdash;Thomas Southern, <i>Isabella, or the Fatal

<p><b>Birtha</b>, the motherless daughter and only child of As'tragon the
Lombard philosopher. In spring she gathered blossoms for her father's
still, in autumn, berries, and in summer, flowers. She fell in love with
duke Grondibert, whose wounds she assisted her father to heal. Birtha,
&quot;in love unpractised and unread,&quot; is the beau-ideal of innocence and
purity of mind. Grondibert had just plighted his love to her when he was
summoned to court, for king Aribert had proclaimed him his successor and
future son-in-law. Gondibert assured Birtha he would remain true to her,
and gave her an emerald ring which he told her would lose its lustre if
he proved untrue. Here the tale breaks off, and as it was never finished
the sequel is not known.&mdash;Sir W. Davenant, <i>Gondibert</i> (died 1668).</p>

wasping.&quot; He dressed to perfection, and though not &quot;wich,&quot; prided
himself on having the &quot;best opewa-box, the best dogs, the best horses,

<p><i>John Blount</i>, eldest son of the Ludgate jeweller. Being left successor
to his father, he sold the goods and set up for a man of fashion and
fortune. His vanity and snobbism were most gross. He had good-nature,
but more cunning than discretion, thought himself far-seeing, but was
most easily duped. &quot;The phaeton was built after my design, my lord,&quot; he
says, &quot;mayhap your lordship has seen it.&quot; &quot;My taste is driving, my lord,
mayhap your lordship has seen me handle the ribbons.&quot; &quot;My horses are all

<p><b>Blue Beard</b> (<i>La Barbe Bleue</i>), from the <i>contes</i> of Charles
Perrault (1697). The chevalier Raoul is a merciless tyrant, with a blue
beard. His young wife is entrusted with all the keys of the castle, with
strict injunctions on pain of death not to open one special room. During
the absence of her lord the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; is too tempting to be
resisted, the door is opened, and the young wife finds the floor covered
with the dead bodies of her husband's former wives. She drops the key in
her terror, and can by no means obliterate from it the stain of blood.
Blue Beard, on his return, commands her to prepare for death, but by the
timely arrival of her brothers her life is saved and Blue Beard put to
death.</p>

<p>Dr. C. Taylor thinks Blue Beard is a type of the castle-lords in the
days of knight-errantry. Some say Henry VIII. (the noted wife-killer)
was the &quot;academy figure.&quot; Others think it was Giles de Retz, marquis de
Laval, marshal of France in 1429, who (according to M&eacute;zeray) murdered
six of his seven wives, and was ultimately strangled in 1440.</p>

<p>Another solution is that Blue Beard was count Conomar&acute;, and the young
wife Triphy&acute;na, daughter of count Guerech. Count Conomar was lieutenant
of Brittany in the reign of Childebert. M. Hippolyte Violeau assures us
that in 1850, during the repairs of the chapel of St. Nicolas de Bieuzy,
some ancient frescoes were discovered with scenes from the life of St.
Triphyna: (1) The marriage; (2) the husband taking leave of his young
wife and entrusting to her a key; (3) a room with an open door, through
which are seen the corpses of seven women hanging; (4) the husband
threatening his wife, while another female [<i>sister Anne</i>] is looking
out of a window above; (5) the husband has placed a halter round the
neck of his victim, but the friends, accompanied by St. Gildas, abbot of
Rhuys in Brittany, arrive just in time to rescue the future saint.&mdash;

Her natural son Genna'ro was brought up by a fisherman in Naples, but

announcing to him that he was of noble blood, but concealing his name
and family. He saved the life of Orsi'ni in the battle of Rin'ini, and
they became sworn friends. In Venice he was introduced to a party of
nobles, all of whom had some tale to tell against Lucrezia: Orsini told
him she had murdered her brother; Vitelli, that she had caused his uncle
to be slain; Liverotto, that she had poisoned his uncle Appia'no;
Gazella, that she had caused one of his relatives to be drowned in the
Tiber. Indignant at these acts of wickedness, Gennaro struck off the B
from the escutcheon of the duke's palace at Ferrara, changing the name
Borgia into Orgia. Lucrezia prayed the duke to put to death the man who
had thus insulted their noble house, and Gennaro was condemned to death
by poison. Lucrezia, to save him, gave him an antidote, and let him out
of prison by a secret door. Soon after his liberation the princess
Negroni, a friend of the Borgias, gave a grand supper, to which Gennaro
and his companions were invited. At the close of the banquet they were
all arrested by Lucrezia after having drunk poisoned wine. Gennaro was
told he was the son of Lucrezia, and died. Lucrezia no sooner saw him
die than she died also.&mdash;Donizetti, <i>Lucrezia di Borgia</i> (an opera,

<p><b>Bounty</b> (<i>Mutiny of the</i>), in 1790, headed by Fletcher Christian.
The mutineers finally settled in Pitcairn Island (Polynesian
Archipelago). In 1808 all the mutineers were dead except one (Alexander
Smith), who had changed his name to John Adams, and became a model
patriarch of the colony, which was taken under the protection of the
British Government in 1839. Lord Byron, in <i>The Island</i>, has made the
&quot;mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>&quot; the basis of his tale, but the facts are
greatly distorted.</p>

<p><b>Bous'trapa,</b> a nickname given to Napoleon III. It is compounded of
the first syllables of <i>Bou</i> [logne], <i>Stra</i> [sbourg], <i>Pa</i>[ris], and

ultimately broke from the enchantress and rejoined the war.&mdash;Tasso,
<i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> (1575).</p>

<p><i>Bower of Bliss</i>, the residence of the witch Acras'ia, a beautiful and

<p><b>Bowkit</b>, in <i>The Son-in-Law.</i></p>

<p>In the scene where Cranky declines to accept Bowkit as son-in-law on
account of his ugliness, John Edwin, who was playing &quot;Bowkit&quot; at the
Haymarket, uttered in a tone of surprise, &quot;<i>Ugly?</i>&quot; and then advancing
to the lamps, said with infinite impertinence, &quot;I submit to the decision
of the British public which is the ugliest fellow of us three: I, old

Welsh,&quot; &quot;Rosamond's Bower,&quot; &quot;Lilly-bullero,&quot; etc. The 6th pastoral is in

<p><b>Boy Blue</b> <i>(Little)</i> is the subject of a poem in Eugene Field's

And the little toy-soldier is red with rust,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his musket moulds in his hands.</span><br>
Time was when the little toy-dog was new,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the soldier was passing fair,</span><br>
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissed them and put them there.</span><br>

The smile of a little face. (1889.)<br>

<p><b>Boy Crucified.</b> It is said that some time during the dark ages, a
boy named Werner was impiously crucified at Bacharach, on the Rhine, by
the Jews. A little chapel erected to the memory of this boy stands on
the walls of the town, close to the river. Hugh of Lincoln and William
of Norwich are instances of a similar story.</p>

<p><b>Brac'cio,</b> commissary of the republic of Florence, employed in
picking up every item of scandal he could find against Lu'ria the noble
Moor, who commanded the army of Florence against the Pisans. The
Florentines hoped to find sufficient cause of blame to lessen or wholly
cancel their obligations to the Moor, but even Braccio was obliged to
confess. This Moor hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear
in his great office, that his virtues would plead like angels,
trumpet-tongued, against the council which should censure him.&mdash;Robert
Browning, <i>Luria</i>.</p>

<p><b>Brac'idas and Am'idas,</b> the two sons of Mile'sio, the former in love
with the wealthy Philtra, and the latter with the dowerless Lucy. Their
father at death left each of his sons an island of equal size and value,
but the sea daily encroached on that of the elder brother and added to
the island of Amidas. The rich Philtra now forsook Bracidas for the
richer brother, and Lucy, seeing herself forsaken, jumped into the sea.
A floating chest attracted her attention, she clung to it, and was
drifted to the wasted island, where Bracidas received her kindly. The
chest was found to contain property of great value, and Lucy gave it to
Bracidas, together with herself, &quot;the better of them both.&quot; Amidas and
Philtra claimed the chest as their right, and the dispute was submitted
to sir Ar'tegal. Sir Artegal decided that whereas Amidas claimed as his
own all the additions which the sea had given to his island, so Lucy
might claim as her own the chest which the sea had given into her
hands.&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, v. 4 (1596).</p>

<p><b>Brad'amant,</b> daughter of Amon and Beatrice, sister of Rinaldo, and
niece of Charlemagne. She was called the <i>Virgin Knight.</i> Her armor was
white, and her plume white. She loved Roge'ro the Moor, but refused to
marry him till he was baptized. Her marriage with great pomp and
Rogero's victory over Rodomont form the subject of the last book of
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>. Bradamant possessed an irresistible spear, which
unhorsed any knight with a touch. Britomart had a similar
spear.&mdash;Bojardo, <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> (1495); Ariosto, <i>Orlando Furioso</i>

<p><b>Brady</b> (<i>Martha</i>), a young &quot;Irish widow&quot; twenty-three years of age,
and in love with William Whittle. She was the daughter of sir Patrick
O'Neale. Old Thomas Whittle, the uncle, a man of sixty-three, wanted to
oust his nephew in her affections, for he thought her &quot;so modest, so
mild, so tenderhearted, so reserved, so domestic. Her voice was so
sweet, with just a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of the brogue to make it enchanting.&quot; In
order to break off this detestable passion of the old man, the widow
assumed the airs and manners of a boisterous, loud, flaunting,
extravagant, low Irishwoman, deeply in debt, and abandoned to pleasure.
Old Whittle, thoroughly frightened, induced his nephew to take the widow
off his hands, and gave him &pound;5000 as a <i>douceur</i> for so doing.&mdash;Garrick,

<p><b>Braganza</b> (<i>Juan duke of</i>). In 1580 Philip II. of Spain claimed the

regent, and Velasquez her chief minister, a man exceedingly obnoxious to
the Portuguese. Don Juan and his wife Louisa of Braganza being very
popular, a conspiracy was formed to shake off the Spanish yoke.
Velasquez was torn to death by the populace, and don Juan of Braganza
was proclaimed king.</p>

<p><i>Louisa duchess of Braganza</i>. Her character is thus described:</p>


<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Bright Louisa,</span><br>
To all the softness of her tender sex,
Unites the noblest qualities of man:

And fortitude that shrinks at no disaster.<br>

<p><b>Brain'worm,</b> the servant of Knowell, a man of infinite shifts, and a

captain Lismaha'go, who is content to take &quot;the maiden&quot; for the sake of

proud, but most considerate to his poorer neighbors. In his first
interview with lieutenant Worthington, &quot;the poor gentleman,&quot; the

<p><b>Bran'dan</b> (<i>Island of St</i>.) or ISLAND of SAN BORANDAN, a flying
island, so late as 1755 set down in geographical charts west of the
Canary group. In 1721 an expedition was sent by Spain in quest thereof.
The Spaniards say their king Rodri'go has retreated there, and the
Portuguese affirm that it is the retreat of their don Sebastian. It was
called St. Brandan from a navigator of the sixth century, who went in
search of the &quot;Islands of Paradise.&quot;</p>

<p>Its reality was for a long time a matter of firm belief ... the garden
of Armi'da, where Rinaldo was detained, and which Tasso places in one of
the Canary Isles, has been identified with San Borandan.&mdash;W. Irving.</p>

<p>(If there is any truth at all in the legend, the island must be ascribed

<p><i>Bray (Vicar of)</i>, supposed by some to be Simon Aleyn, who lived (says
Fuller) &quot;in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth.
In the first two reigns he was a <i>protestant</i>, in Mary's reign a
<i>catholic</i>, and in Elizabeth's a <i>protestant</i> again.&quot; No matter who was
king, Simon Aleyn resolved to live and die &quot;the vicar of Bray&quot;
(1540-1588).</p>

<p>Others think the vicar was Simon Symonds, who (according to Ray) was an

Charles II., a <i>papist</i> under James II., and a <i>moderate churchman</i> in

<p>The next we hear of was made by Rob. Grosseteste (1175-1253).</p>

<p>The third was the famous brazen head of Albertus Magnus, which cost him
thirty years' labor, and was broken to pieces by his disciple Thomas
Aqui&acute;nas (1193-1280).</p>

<p>The fourth was that of friar Bacon, which used to say, &quot;Time is, time

when success seems within his grasp is thwarted by the discovery of a

departed friend, he remarks, parenthetically: &quot;He always thought it were
better for ministers to pray oftener and divide their prayers, than be
long and tedious in the same (except upon solemn and special occasions,
as in days of humiliation and the like). His reason was that the hearts
and spirits of all, especially the weak, continue and stand bent (as it
were) so long towards God as they ought to do in that duty without
flagging and falling off.&quot; This is a remarkable deliverance for a day
when two-hour prayers were the rule, and from a man who, his biographer
tells us, &quot;had a singular good gift in prayer.&quot;</p>

novels, presenting a unity of plot and action from beginning to end. The
old butler, Caleb Balderston, is exaggerated and far too prominent, but
he serves as a foil to the tragic scenes.</p>

In <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> we see embodied<br>

Britons and Welsh from Brutus, great-grandson of Trojan &AElig;neas to the

archdeacon of Monmouth and then bishop of St. Asaph. The general outline
of the work is the same as that given by Nennius three centuries

<p><b>Brit'omart</b>, the representative of chastity. She was the daughter
and heiress of king Ryence of Wales, and her legend forms the third book
of the <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>. One day, looking into Venus's looking-glass, given
by Merlin to her father, she saw therein sir Artegal, and fell in love
with him. Her nurse Glauc&ecirc; (2 <i>syl</i>.) tried by charms &quot;to undo her
love,&quot; but love that is in gentle heart begun no idle charm can remove.
Finding her &quot;charms&quot; ineffectual, she took her to Merlin's cave in
Caermarthen, and the magician told her she would be the mother of a line
of kings (<i>the Tudors</i>), and after twice 400 years one of her offspring,
&quot;a royal virgin,&quot; would shake the power of Spain. Glauc&ecirc; now suggested
that they should start in quest of sir Artegal, and Britomart donned the
armor of An'gela (queen of the Angles), which she found in her father's
armory, and taking a magic spear which &quot;nothing could resist,&quot; she
sallied forth. Her adventures allegorize the triumph of chastity over
impurity: Thus in Castle Joyous, Malacasta <i>(lust)</i>, not knowing her
sex, tried to seduce her, &quot;but she flees youthful lust, which wars
against the soul.&quot; She next overthrew Marinel, son of Cym'oent. Then
made her appearance as the Squire of Dames. Her last achievement was the
deliverance of Am'oret <i>(wifely love)</i> from the enchanter Busirane. Her
marriage is deferred to bk. v. 6, when she tilted with sir Artegal, who
&quot;shares away the ventail of her helmet with his sword,&quot; and was about to
strike again when he became so amazed at her beauty that he thought she
must be a goddess. She bade the knight remove his helmet, at once
recognized him, consented &quot;to be his love, and to take him for her
lord.&quot;&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iii. (1590).</p>

of the United States.&mdash;J. R. Bartlett, <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i>.</p>

went home and died.&mdash;<i>The Spectator</i>.</p>

<p><b>Brunhild,</b> queen of Issland, who made a vow that none should win her
who could not surpass her in three trials of skill and strength: (1)
hurling a spear; (2) throwing a stone; and (3) jumping. G&uuml;nther king of
Burgundy undertook the three contests, and by the aid of Siegfried
succeeded in winning the martial queen. <i>First</i>, hurling a spear that
three men could scarcely lift: the queen hurled it towards G&uuml;nther, but
Siegfried, in his invisible cloak, reversed its direction, causing it to
strike the queen and knock her down. <i>Next</i>, throwing a stone so huge
that twelve brawny men were employed to carry it: Brunhild lifted it on
high, flung it twelve fathoms, and jumped beyond it. Again Siegfried
helped his friend to throw it further, and in leaping beyond the stone.
The queen, being fairly beaten, exclaimed to her liegemen, &quot;I am no
longer your queen and mistress; henceforth are ye the liegemen of
G&uuml;nther&quot; (lied vii.). After marriage Brunhild was so obstreperous that
the king again applied to Siegfried, who succeeded in depriving her of
her ring and girdle, after which she became a very submissive
wife.&mdash;<i>The Niebelungen Lied</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bru&acute;no</b> (<i>Bishop</i>), bishop of Herbipolita&acute;num. Sailing one day on
the Danube with Henry III. emperor of Germany, they came to Ben Strudel
(&quot;the devouring-gulf&quot;), near Grinon Castle, in Austria. Here the voice
of a spirit clamored aloud, &quot;Ho! ho! Bishop Bruno, whither art thou
travelling? But go thy ways, bishop Bruno, for thou shalt travel with me
tonight.&quot; At night, while feasting with the emperor, a rafter fell on
his head and killed him. Southey has a ballad called <i>Bishop Bruno</i>, but
it deviates from the original legend given by Heywood in several
particulars: It makes bishop Bruno hear the voice first on his way to
the emperor, who had invited him to dinner; next, at the beginning of
dinner; and thirdly, when the guests had well feasted. At the last
warning an ice-cold hand touched him, and Bruno fell dead in the banquet
hall.</p>

<p><b>Brush</b>, the impertinent English valet of lord Ogleby. If his
lordship calls he never hears unless he chooses; if his bell rings he
never answers it till it suits his pleasure. He helps himself freely to
all his master's things, and makes love to all the pretty chambermaids
he comes into contact with.&mdash;Colman and Garrick, <i>The Clandestine
Marriage</i> (1766).</p>

<p><b>Brute</b> (1 <i>syl</i>.), the first king of Britain (in mythical history).
He was the son of &AElig;neas Silvius (grandson of Ascanius and great-grandson
of &AElig;neas of Troy). Brute called London (the capital of his adopted
country) Troynovant (<i>New Troy</i>). The legend is this: An oracle declared
that Brute should be the death of both his parents; his mother died in
child-birth, and at the age of fifteen Brute shot his father
accidentally in a deer-hunt. Being driven from Alba Longa, he collected
a band of old Trojans and landed at Totness, in Devonshire. His wife was
Innogen, daughter of Pandra'sus king of Greece. His tale is told at
length in the <i>Chronicles</i> of Geoffrey of Monmouth, in the first song of
Drayton's <i>Polyolbion</i>, and in Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, ii.</p>

<p><i>Brute (Sir John)</i>, a coarse, surly, ill-mannered brute, whose delight
was to &quot;provoke&quot; his young wife, who he tells us &quot;is a young lady, a
fine lady, a witty lady, and a virtuous lady, but yet I hate her.&quot; In a
drunken frolic he intercepts a tailor taking home a new dress to lady
Brute; he insists on arraying himself therein, is arrested for a street
row, and taken before the justice of the peace. Being asked his name, he
gives it as &quot;lady John Brute,&quot; and is dismissed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Brute</i>, wife of sir John. She is subjected to divers indignities,
and insulted morn, noon, and night by her surly, drunken husband. Lady
Brute intrigues with Constant, a former lover; but her intrigues are
more mischievous than vicious.&mdash;Vanbrugh, <i>The Provoked Wife</i> (1697).</p>

<p><b>Brute Green-Shield,</b> the successor of
Ebranc king of Britain. The mythical line
is: (1) Brute, great-great-grandson of
&AElig;neas; (2) Locrin, his son; (3) Guendolen,
the widow of Locrin; (4) Ebranc; (5) Brute
Green-Shield. Then follow in order Leil,
Hudibras, Bladud, Leir [Shakespeare's
&quot;Lear&quot;], etc.</p>

<p><b>Brutus</b> (<i>Lucius Junius</i>), first consul of
Rome, who condemned his own two sons
to death for joining a conspiracy to restore
Tarquin to the throne, from which he had
been banished. This subject has been
dramatized by N. Lee (1679) and John H.
Payne, under the title of <i>Brutus, or the</i>
<i>Fall of Tarquin</i> (1820). Alfieri has an
Italian tragedy on the same subject. In
French we have the tragedies of Arnault
(1792) and Ponsard (1843). (See LUCRETIA.)</p>

<p>The elder Kean on one occasion consented to appear at the Glasgow
theatre for his son's benefit. The play chosen was Payne's <i>Brutus</i>, in
which the father took the part of &quot;Brutus&quot; and Charles Kean that of
&quot;Titus.&quot; The audience sat suffused in tears during the pathetic
interview, till &quot;Brutus&quot; falls on the neck of &quot;Titus,&quot; exclaiming in a
burst of agony, &quot;Embrace thy wretched father!&quot; when the whole house
broke forth into peals of approbation. Edmund Kean then whispered in his
son's ear, &quot;Charlie, we are doing the trick.&quot;&mdash;W. C. Russell,
<i>Representative Actors</i>, p. 476.</p>

<p><i>Junius Brutus</i>. So James Lynch Fitz-Stephen has been called, because
(like the first consul of Rome) he condemned his own son to death for
murder, and to prevent a rescue caused him to be executed from the
window of his own house in Galway (1493).</p>

<p><i>The Spanish Brutus</i>, Alfonso Perez de Gruzman, governor of Tarifa in
1293. Here he was besieged by the infant don Juan, who had revolted
against his brother, king Sancho IV., and having Guzman's son in his
power threatened to kill him unless Tarifa was given up to him. Guzman
replied, &quot;Sooner than be guilty of such treason I will lend Juan a
dagger to slay my son;&quot; and so saying tossed his dagger over the wall.
Sad to say, Juan took the dagger, and assassinated the young man there
and then (1258-1309).</p>

<p><i>Brutus (Marcus)</i>, said to be the son of Julius C&aelig;sar by Servilia.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Brutus' bastard hand</span><br>
Stabb'd Julius C&aelig;sar.<br>
Shakespeare, 2 <i>Henry VI</i>. act iv. sc. 1 (1591).<br>

<p>This Brutus is introduced by Shakespeare in his tragedy of <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>, and the poet endows him with every quality of a true patriot.
He loved C&aelig;sar much, but he loved Rome more.</p>

<p><i>Brutus. Et tu, Brute</i>. Shakespeare, on the authority of Suetonius, puts
these words into the mouth of C&aelig;sar when Brutus stabbed him.
Shakespeare's drama was written in 1607, and probably he had seen <i>The
True Tragedy of Richard duke of York</i> (1600), where these words occur;
but even before that date H. Stephens had said:</p>

<p>Jule Cesar, quand il vit que Brutus aussi estoit de ceux qui luy tirient
des coups d'espee, luy dit, <i>Kai sy tecnon</i>? c'est &agrave; dire.... Et toy mon
fils, en es tu aussi.&mdash;<i>Deux Dial. du Noveau Lang. Franc</i> (1583).</p>

<p><b>Brutus and Cicero.</b> Cicero says: [Latin: &quot;C&aelig;sare interfecto, statim,
cruentum alte extollens M. Brutus pugionem <i>Ciceronem</i> nominatim
exclamavit, atque ei recuperatam libertatem est
gratulatus.&quot;]&mdash;<i>Philipp</i>. ii. 12.</p>

<p>When Brutus rose, Refulgent from the stroke of C&aelig;sar's fate,...
[<i>he</i>] called aloud On Tully's name, and shook his crimson steel, And
bade the &quot;father of his country&quot; hail.</p>

Craddock's <i>In the Stranger People's Country</i>.</p>

<p>He had been a brave soldier, although the flavor of bushwhacking clung
to his war record; he was a fast friend and a generous foe; what one
hand got by hook or by crook&mdash;chiefly, it is to be feared, by crook&mdash;the
other made haste to give away (1890).</p>

<p><b>Buck Fanshawe</b>, a popular Californian in the days when Lynch Law was
in vogue in mining districts. He dies, and his partner seeks a clergyman
to arrange for the funeral, which &quot;the fellows&quot; have determined shall be
the finest ever held in the region. The divine questions in his
professional vein and the miner answers in <i>his</i>, each sorely puzzled to

<p><b>Buckingham</b> (<i>George Villiers, duke of</i>). There were two dukes of
this name, father and son, both notorious for their profligacy and
political unscrupulousness. The first (1592-1628) was the favorite of
James I., nicknamed &quot;Steenie&quot; by that monarch from his personal beauty,
&quot;Steenie&quot; being a pet corruption of Stephen, whose face at martyrdom was
&quot;as the face of an angel.&quot; He was assassinated by Fenton. Sir Walter
Scott introduces him in <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>, and his son in <i>Peveril
of the Peak</i>. The son (1627-1688) also appears under the name of &quot;Zimri&quot;
(q.v.) in Dryden's <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. He was the author of <i>The
Rehearsal</i>, a drama upon which Sheridan founded his <i>Critic</i>, and of
other works, but is principally remembered as the profligate favorite of
Charles II. He was a member of the famous &quot;CABAL&quot; (q.v.), and closed a
career of great splendor and wickedness in the most abject poverty.</p>

<p><i>Buckingham</i> (<i>Henry de Stafford, duke of</i>) was a favorite of Richard
III. and a participator in his crimes, but revolted against him, and was
beheaded in 1483. This is the duke that Sackville met in the realms of
Pluto, and whose &quot;complaynt&quot; is given in the prologue to <i>A Mirrour for
Magistraytes</i> (1587). He also appears in Shakespeare's <i>Richard III.</i>
His son in <i>Henry VIII.</i></p>

Ravenswood, and they exchange love-tokens at the Mermaid's Fountain; but
her father, sir William Ashton, from pecuniary views, promises her in
marriage to the laird of Bucklaw, and as she signs the articles Edgar
suddenly appears at the castle. They return to each other their
love-tokens, and Lucy is married to the laird; but on the wedding night
the bridegroom is found dangerously wounded in the bridal chamber, and
the bride hidden in the chimney-corner insane. Lucy dies in convulsions,
but Bucklaw recovers and goes abroad.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>The Bride of
Lammermoor</i> (time, William III.).</p>

<p><b>Buckthorne</b>, a conspicuous figure in <i>Tales of a Traveller</i>, by
Washington Irving. He is gentleman student, dancing buffoon, lover,
poet, and author by turns, and nothing long unless it be a royally good
fellow (1824).</p>

tempering the wildest passion with the deepest respect.&mdash;Victor Hugo,
<i>Bug Jargal</i> (a novel).</p>

(by Tennyson), the prince, disguised as a woman, enters with his two
friends (similarly disguised) into the college to which no man was
admitted, he sings; and the princess, suspecting the fraud, says to him,
&quot;Not for thee, O bulbul, any rose of Gulistan shall burst her veil,&quot;
i.e., &quot;O singer, do not suppose that any woman will be taken in by such
a flimsy deceit.&quot; The bulbul loved the rose, and Gulistan means the
&quot;garden of roses.&quot; The prince was the bulbul, the college was Gulistan,
and the princess the rose sought.&mdash;Tennyson, <i>The Princess</i>, iv.</p>

estates (<i>i.e. the Spanish throne</i>), she said to John Bull:</p>

&quot;You sot, you loiter about ale-houses and taverns,<br>
spend your time at billiards, ninepins, or<br>
puppet-shows, never minding me nor my numerous<br>

John had a sister, a poor girl that had been<br>
reared ... on oatmeal and water ... and lodged<br>
in a garret exposed to the north wind.... However,<br>
this usage ... gave her a hardy constitution....<br>
Peg had, indeed, some odd humors and<br>
comical antipathies,... she would faint at the<br>
sound of an organ, and yet dance and frisk at<br>
the noise of a bagpipe.&mdash;Dr. Arbuthnot, <i>History<br>

<p><b>Bullamy</b>, porter of the &quot;Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life

<p><b>Bum&acute;ble,</b> beadle of the workhouse where Oliver Twist was born and
brought up. A stout, consequential, hard-hearted, fussy official, with
mighty ideas of his own importance. This character has given to the

conceit of a parish authority or petty dignitary. After marriage the
high-and-mighty beadle was sadly henpecked and reduced to a Jerry
Sneak.&mdash;C. Dickens, <i>Oliver Twist</i> (1837).</p>

rescues the &quot;recreant knight&quot; from the mob, but blames him for his
unknightly folly in throwing away his shield (of faith). Talus (<i>the

movement, though little or nothing is said. Puff, in his tragedy of the
&quot;Spanish Armada,&quot; introduces lord Burleigh, &quot;who has the affairs of the
whole nation in his head, and has no time to talk;&quot; but his lordship
comes on the stage and shakes his head, by which he means far more than
words could utter. Puff says:</p>

recorded by Rev. Cotton Mather. The counts are many, and in the opinion
of the court are proven, George Burroughs being condemned to die. In the
story of his crimes set down by Dr. Mather, the climax would seem to be
a paper handed by the accused to the jury, &quot;wherein he goes to evince
'That there neither are, nor ever were, witches that, having made a
compact with the devil, can send a devil to torment other people at a
distance.'&quot;</p>

about the matter; then lord Suckfist replied, and the bench declared &quot;We
have not understood one iota of the defence.&quot; Pantag'ruel, however, gave
judgment, and as both plaintiff and defendant considered he had got the
verdict, both were fully satisfied, &quot;a thing without parallel in all the

twenty-four. She pretends to love &quot;Gardy,&quot; and dupes him into yielding
up her money, and giving his consent to her marriage with &quot;the man of
her choice,&quot; believing himself to be the person. Charles is in love with
Isabinda, daughter of sir Jealous Traffick, who has made up his mind
that she shall marry a Spaniard named don Diego Babinetto, expected to
arrive forthwith. Charles dresses in a Spanish costume, passes himself
off as the expected don, and is married to the lady of his choice; so
both the old men are duped, and all the young people wed according to

Sergeant Buzfuz is a driving, chaffing, masculine bar orator, who proved
that Mr. Pickwick's note about &quot;chops and tomato sauce&quot; was a

employ, at one and the same time, his ears to listen, his eyes to read,
his hand to write, and his tongue to dictate.&quot; He is said to have
conquered three hundred nations; to have taken eight hundred cities, to
have slain in battle a million men, and to have defeated three millions.
(See below, C&AElig;SAR'S WARS.)</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar and his Fortune</i>. Plutarch says that C&aelig;sar told the captain of
the vessel in which he sailed that no harm could come to his ship, for
that he had &quot;C&aelig;sar and his fortune with him.&quot;</p>

Now am I like that proud insulting ship,<br>
Which C&aelig;sar and his fortune bare at once.<br>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar saves his Commentaries</i>. Once, when Julius C&aelig;sar was in danger
of being upset into the sea by the overloading of a boat, he swam to the
nearest ship, with his book of <i>Commentaries</i> in his hand.&mdash;Suetonius.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar's Death</i>. Both Chaucer and Shakespeare say that Julius C&aelig;sar
was killed in the capitol. Thus Polonius says to Hamlet, &quot;I did enact
Julius C&aelig;sar; I was killed i' the capitol&quot; (<i>Hamlet</i>, act iii. sc. 2).
And Chaucer says:</p>

This Julius to the capitol&ecirc; wente ...<br>
And in the capitole anon him hente<br>
This fals&ecirc; Brutus, and his other soon,<br>
And sticked him with bod&euml;kins anon.<br>

<p><i>Canterbury Tales</i> (&quot;The Monk's Tale,&quot; 1388).</p>

<p>Plutarch expressly tells us he was killed in Pompey's Porch or Piazza;
and in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> Shakespeare says he fell &quot;e'en at the base of
Pompey's statue&quot; (act iii. sc. 2).</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar's Famous Despatch</i>, &quot;Veni, vidi, vici,&quot; written to the senate to
announce his overthrow of Pharnac&ecirc;s king of Pontus. This &quot;hop, skip, and
a jump&quot; was, however, the work of three days.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar's Wars</i>. The carnage occasioned by the wars of C&aelig;sar is usually
estimated at a million fighting men. He won 320 triumphs, and fought 500
battles. See above, C&AElig;SAR (<i>Caius Julius</i>).</p>

What millions died that C&aelig;sar might be great!<br>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar</i>, the Mephistoph'el&ecirc;s of Byron's unfinished drama called <i>The
Deformed Transformed</i>. This C&aelig;sar changes Arnold (the hunchback) into
the form of Achilles, and assumes himself the deformity and ugliness
which Arnold casts off. The drama being incomplete, all that can be said
is that C&aelig;sar, in cynicism, effrontery, and snarling bitterness of
spirit, is the exact counterpart of his prototype, Mephistophel&ecirc;s
(1821).</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar (Don)</i>, an old man of sixty-three, the father of Olivia. In
order to induce his daughter to marry, he makes love to Marcella, a girl
of sixteen.&mdash;Mrs. Cowley, <i>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</i> (1782).</p>

<p><b>Cael</b>, a Highlander of the western coast of Scotland. These Cael had
colonized, in very remote times, the northern parts of Ireland, as the
Fir-bolg or Belgae of Britain had colonized the southern parts. The two
colonies had each a separate king. When Crothar was king of the Fir-bolg
(or &quot;lord of Atha&quot;), he carried off Conla'ma, daughter of the king of
Ulster (<i>i.e.</i> &quot;chief of the Cael&quot;), and a general war ensued between
the two races. The Cael, being reduced to the last extremity, sent to
Trathal (Fingal's grandfather) for help, and Trathal sent over Con'ar,
who was chosen &quot;king of the Cael&quot; immediately he landed in Ulster; and
having reduced the Fir-bolg to submission, he assumed the title of &quot;king
of Ireland.&quot; The Fir-bolg, though conquered, often rose in rebellion,
and made many efforts to expel the race of Conar, but never succeeded in
so doing.&mdash;Ossian.</p>

<p>Edward I. confined the countess of Buchan in an iron cage, for placing
the crown of Scotland on the head of Bruce. This cage was erected on one
of the towers of Berwick Castle, where the countess was exposed to the

<p><b>Cain and Abel</b> are called in the <i>Kor&acirc;n</i> &quot;K&acirc;bil and H&acirc;bil.&quot; The
tradition is that Cain was commanded to marry Abel's sister, and Abel to
marry Cain's, but Cain demurred because his own sister was the more
beautiful, and so the matter was referred to God, and God answered &quot;No&quot;
by rejecting Cain's sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans also say that Cain carried about with him the dead body
of Abel till he saw a raven scratch a hole in the ground to bury a dead
bird. The hint was taken, and Abel was buried under ground.&mdash;Sale's

Cormac &quot;king of Ireland,&quot; murdered him (<i>Temora</i>, i.), and usurped the
throne; but Fingal (who was distantly related to Cormac) went to Ireland
with an army, to restore the ancient dynasty. Cairbar invited Oscar
(Fingal's grandson) to a feast, and Oscar accepted the invitation, but
Cairbar having provoked a quarrel with his guest, the two fought, and
both were slain.</p>

<p><b>Calan&acute;tha,</b> princess of Sparta, loved by Ith&acute;ocl&ecirc;s. Ithocl&ecirc;s induces
his sister, Penthe&acute;a, to break the matter to the princess. This she
does; the princess is won to requite his love, and the king consents to
the union. During a grand court ceremony Calantha is informed of the
sudden death of her father, another announces to her that Penthea had
starved herself to death from hatred to Bass&acute;an&ecirc;s, and a third follows
to tell her that Ithocl&ecirc;s, her betrothed husband, has been murdered.
Calantha bates no jot of the ceremony, but continues the dance even to
the bitter end. The coronation ensues, but scarcely is the ceremony over
than she can support the strain no longer, and, broken-hearted, she
falls dead.&mdash;John Ford, <i>The Broken Heart</i> (1633).</p>

<p><i>The Three Calenders</i>, three royal princes, disguised as begging
dervishes, each of whom had lost his right eye. Their adventures form
three tales in the <i>Arabian Nights' Entertainments</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tale of the First Calender</i>. No names are given. This calender was the
son of a king, and nephew of another king. While on a visit to his uncle
his father died, and the vizier usurped the throne. When the prince
returned, he was seized, and the usurper pulled out his right eye. The
uncle died, and the usurping vizier made himself master of this kingdom
also. So the hapless young prince assumed the garb of a calender,
wandered to Baghdad, and being received into the house of &quot;the three
sisters,&quot; told his tale in the hearing of the caliph
Haroun-al-Raschid.&mdash;<i>The Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tale of the Second Calender.</i> No names given. This calender, like the
first, was the son of a king. On his way to India he was attacked by
robbers, and though he contrived to escape, he lost all his effects. In
his flight he came to a large city, where he encountered a tailor, who
gave him food and lodging. In order to earn a living, he turned woodman
for the nonce, and accidentally discovered an underground palace, in
which lived a beautiful lady, confined there by an evil genius. With a
view of liberating her, he kicked down the talisman, when the genius
appeared, killed the lady, and turned the prince into an ape. As an ape
he was taken on board ship, and transported to a large commercial city,
where his penmanship recommended him to the sultan, who made him his
vizier. The sultan's daughter undertook to disenchant him and restore
him to his proper form; but to accomplish this she had to fight with the
malignant genius. She succeeded in killing the genius, and restoring the
enchanted prince; but received such severe injuries in the struggle that
she died, and a spark of fire which flew into the right eye of the
prince destroyed it. The sultan was so heart-broken at the death of his
only child, that he insisted on the prince quitting the kingdom without
delay. So he assumed the garb of a calender, and being received into the
hospitable house of &quot;the three sisters,&quot; told his tale in the hearing of
the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid.&mdash;<i>The Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tale of the Third Calender.</i> This tale is given under the word AGIB.</p>

&quot;I am called Agib,&quot; he says, &quot;and am the son<br>
of a king whose name was Cassib.&quot;&mdash;<i>Arabian<br>

<p><b>Calepine</b> (<i>Sir</i>), the knight attached to
Sere&acute;na (canto 3). Seeing a bear carrying

<p><b>Cal&acute;idore</b> (<i>Sir</i>), the type of courtesy,

was sir Philip Sidney. Sir Calidore (3
<i>syl.</i>) starts in quest of the Blatant Beast,
which had escaped from sir Artegal (bk. v.
12). He first compels the lady Bria&acute;na to
discontinue her discourteous toll of &quot;the
locks of ladies and the beards of knights&quot;
(canto 1). Sir Calidore falls in love with
Pastorella, a shepherdess, dresses like a
shepherd, and assists his lady-love in keeping
sheep. Pastorella being taken captive
by brigands, sir Calidore rescues her, and
leaves her at Belgard Castle to be taken
care of, while he goes in quest of the Blatant
Beast. He finds the monster after a
time, by the havoc it had made with religious
houses, and after an obstinate fight
succeeds in muzzling it, and dragging it in
chains after him, but it got loose again, as
it did before (canto 12).&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fa&euml;ry

engaged to marry Al&acute;tamont, a young lord who loved her dearly. On the
wedding-day a letter was picked up which proved her guilt, and she was
subsequently seen by Altamont conversing with Lothario. A duel ensued,
in which Lothario fell; in a street row Sciolto received his
death-wound, and Calista stabbed herself. The character of &quot;Calista&quot; was

Teutha (<i>the Tweed</i>), and the two boys were brought up by the murderer
in his own house, and accompanied him in his wars. As they grew in years
Dunthalmo fancied he perceived in their looks a something which excited
his suspicions, so he shut them up in two separate dark caves on the
banks of the Tweed. Colmal, daughter of Dunthalmo, dressed as a young
warrior, liberated Calthon, and fled with him to Morven, to crave aid in
behalf of the captive Colmar. Accordingly, Fingal sent his son Ossian
with 300 men to effect his liberation. When Dunthalmo heard of the

<p><i>Cal&acute;ydon</i>, a town of Aeto&acute;lia, founded by Calydon. In Arthurian romance
Calydon is a forest in the north of our island. Probably it is what
Richard of Cirencester calls the &quot;Caledonian Wood,&quot; westward of the
Varar or Murray Frith.</p>

<p><b>Calydo&acute;nian Hunt.</b> Artemis, to punish Oeneus [<i>E&acute;.nuce</i>] king of
Cal&acute;ydon, in Aeto&acute;lia, for neglect, sent a monster boar to ravage his
vineyards. His son Melea&acute;ger collected together a large company to hunt
it. The boar being killed, a dispute arose respecting the head, and this
led to a war between the Curet&ecirc;s and Calydo&acute;nians.</p>

<p>A similar tale is told of Theseus (<i>2 syl.</i>), who vanquished and killed

but one night, by fairy influence,
being shown Badou&acute;ra, only child of the
king of China, he fell in love with her and
exchanged rings. Next day both inquired
what had become of the other, and the

who asked the lady Canac&ecirc; to wife, the terms being that none should have
her till he had succeeded in worsting Camballo in combat. Chaucer does
not give us the sequel of this tale, but Spenser says that three
brothers, named Priamond, Diamond, and Triamond were suitors, and that
Triamond won her. The mother of these three (all born at one birth) was

third (named Tri&acute;amond), she appeared in the lists in her chariot drawn
by two lions, and brought with her a cup of nepenthe, which had the
power of converting hate to love, of producing oblivion of sorrow, and
of inspiring the mind with celestial joy. Cambina touched the combatants
with her wand and paralyzed them, then giving them the cup to drink,
dissolved their animosity, assuaged their pains, and filled them with
gladness. The end was that Camballo made Cambina his wife, and Triamond

<p><b>Captain Loys</b> [<i>Lo.is</i>]. Louise Lab&eacute; was so called, because in early
life she embraced the profession of arms, and gave repeated proofs of
great valor. She was also called <i>La Belle Cordi&egrave;re</i>. Louise Lab&eacute; was a
poetess, and has left several sonnets full of passion, and some good
elegies (1526-1566).</p>

<p><b>Captain Right</b>, a fictitious commander,
the ideal of the rights due to Ireland. In
the last century the peasants of Ireland
were sworn to captain Right, as chartists
were sworn to their articles of demand

<p><b>Car'abas</b> (<i>Le marquis de</i>), an hypothetical title to express a

made for his &quot;hunting-ground;&quot; and, therefore, as B&eacute;ranger says:</p>

Chapeau bas! chapeau bas!<br>
Gloire au marquis de Carabas!<br>

<p>The name occurs in Perrault's tale of <i>Puss in Boots</i>, but it is
B&eacute;ranger's song (1816) which has given the word its present meaning.</p>

betrayed him to the Romans, A.D. 47.&mdash;Richard of Cirencester, <i>Ancient

<p>Caradoc was led captive to Rome, A.D. 51, and, struck with the grandeur
of that city, exclaimed, &quot;Is it possible that a people so wealthy and
luxurious can envy me a humble cottage in Britain?&quot; Claudius the emperor
was so charmed with his manly spirit and bearing that he released him
and craved his friendship.</p>

<p>Drayton says that Caradoc went to Rome with body naked, hair to the

because he adopted the Gaulish <i>caracalla</i> in preference to the Roman
<i>toga</i>.&mdash;Ossian, <i>Comala</i>.</p>

<p>The Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who (as the son of

said, &quot;Content yourself, my son, with commanding
their beards to be burnt. Beards

live with her husband. The marriage is eventually set aside, and Grace
Carden espouses Henry Little.&mdash;Charles Reade, <i>Put Yourself in His
Place</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carde&acute;nio</b> of Andalusi&acute;a, of opulent parents, fell in love with
Lucinda, a lady of equal family and fortune, to whom he was formally
engaged. Don Fernando his friend, however, prevailed on Lucinda's
father, by artifice, to break off the engagement and promise Lucinda to
himself, &quot;contrary to her wish, and in violation of every principle of
honor.&quot; This drove Cardenio mad, and he haunted the Sierra Morena or
Brown Mountain for about six months, as a maniac with lucid intervals.
On the wedding-day Lucinda swooned, and a letter informed the bridegroom
that she was married to Cardenio. Next day she privately left her
father's house and took refuge in a convent; but being abducted by don
Fernando, she was carried to an inn, where Fernando found Dorothea his
wife, and Cardenio the husband of Lucinda. All parties were now
reconciled, and the two gentlemen paired respectively with their proper
wives.&mdash;Cervantes, <i>Don Quixote</i>, I. iv. (1605).</p>

<p><b>Careless Husband</b> <i>(The)</i>, a comedy by Colley Cibber (1704). The
&quot;careless husband&quot; is sir Charles Easy, who has amours with different
persons, but is so careless that he leaves his love-letters about, and
even forgets to lock the door when he has made a <i>liaison</i>, so that his
wife knows all; yet so sweet is her temper, and under such entire
control, that she never reproaches him, nor shows the slightest
indication of jealousy. Her confidence so wins upon her husband that he
confesses to her his faults, and reforms entirely the evil of his ways.</p>

<p><b>Car&ecirc;me</b> <i>(Jean de), chef de cuisine</i> of Leo X. This was a name given
him by the pope for an admirable <i>soupe maigre</i> which he invented for
Lent. A descendant of Jean was <i>chef</i> to the prince regent, at a salary
of &pound;1000 per annum, but he left this situation because the prince had
only a <i>m&eacute;nage bourgeois</i>, and entered the service of baron Rothschild

<p><b>Car'ker</b> <i>(James)</i>, manager in the house of Mr. Dombey, merchant.
Carker was a man of forty, of a florid complexion, with very glistening
white teeth, which showed conspicuously when he spoke. His smile was
like &quot;the snarl of a cat.&quot; He was the Alas'tor of the house of Dombey,
for he not only brought the firm to bankruptcy, but he seduced Alice
Marwood (cousin of Edith, Dombey's second wife), and also induced Edith
to elope with him. Edith left the wretch at Dijon, and Carker, returning
to England, was run over by a railway train and killed.</p>

twice robbed it and was forgiven.</p>

<p><i>Harriet Carker</i>, a gentle, beautiful young woman, who married Mr.
Morfin, one of the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> in the house of Mr. Dombey, merchant. When

<p><b>Car&acute;los</b>, elder son of don Antonio, and the favorite of his paternal
uncle Lewis. Carlos is a great bookworm, but when he falls in love with
Angelina he throws off his diffidence and becomes bold, resolute, and
manly. His younger brother is Clodio, a mere coxcomb.&mdash;C. Cibber, <i>Love
Makes a Man</i> (1694).</p>

<p><i>Carlos</i> (under the assumed name of the marquis D'Antas) married
Ogari&acute;ta, but as the marriage was effected under a false name it was not
binding, and Ogarita left Carlos to marry Horace de Brienne. Carlos was
a great villain: he murdered a man to steal from him the plans of some
Californian mines. Then embarking in the <i>Urania</i>, he induced the crew
to rebel in order to obtain mastery of the ship. &quot;Gold was the object of
his desire, and gold he obtained.&quot; Ultimately, his villainies being
discovered, he was given up to the hands of justice.&mdash;E. Stirling, <i>The
Orphan of the Frozen Sea</i> (1856).</p>

<p><i>Carlos (Don)</i>, son of Philip II. of Portugal; deformed in person,
violent and vindictive in disposition. Don Carlos was to have married
Elizabeth of France, but his father supplanted him. Subsequently he
expected to marry the arch-duchess Anne, daughter of the emperor
Maximilian, but her father opposed the match. In 1564 Philip II. settled
the succession on Rodolph and Ernest, his nephews, declaring Carlos
incapable. This drove Carlos into treason, and he joined the Netherlands
in a war against his father. He was apprehended and condemned to death,
but was killed in prison. This has furnished the subject of several
tragedies: <i>i.e.</i>, Otway's <i>Don Carlos</i> (1672), in English; those of
J.G. de Campistron (1683) and M.J. de Ch&eacute;nier (1789) in French; J.C.F.
Schiller (1798) in German; Alfieri in Italian, about the same time.</p>

<p><i>Car'los (Don)</i>, the friend of don Alonzo, and the betrothed husband of
Leono'ra, whom he resigns to Alonzo out of friendship. After marriage,
Zanga induces Alonzo to believe that Leonora and don Carlos entertain a
criminal love for each other, whereupon Alonzo, out of jealousy, has
Carlos put to death, and Leonora kills herself.&mdash;Edward Young, <i>The
Revenge</i> (1721).</p>

<p><i>Carlos (Don)</i>, husband of donna Victoria. He gave the deeds of his
wife's estate to donna Laura, a courtesan, and Victoria, in order to
recover them, assumed the disguise of a man, took the name of Florio,
and made love to her. Having secured a footing, Florio introduced Gaspar
as the wealthy uncle of Victoria, and Gaspar told Laura the deeds in her
hand were utterly worthless. Laura in a fit of temper tore them to
atoms, and thus Carlos recovered the estate and was rescued from
impending ruin.&mdash;Mrs. Cowley, <i>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</i> (1782).</p>

<p><i>Carmen (Eschelle)</i>, beautiful, ambitious, and intriguing New York
society girl.&mdash;Charles Dudley Warner, <i>A Little Journey in the World</i>
(1889).</p>

<p><b>Car&acute;milhan,</b> the &quot;phantom ship.&quot; The captain of this ship swore he
would double the Cape, whether God willed it or not, for which impious
vow he was doomed to abide forever and ever captain in the same vessel,
which always appears near the Cape, but never doubles it. The kobold of
the phantom ship is named Klabot&acute;erman, a kobold who helps sailors at
their work, but beats those who are idle. When a vessel is doomed the
kobold appears smoking a short pipe, dressed in yellow, and wearing a
night-cap.</p>

<p><b>Caro,</b> the Flesh or &quot;natural man&quot; personified. Phineas Fletcher says
&quot;this dam of sin&quot; is a hag of loathsome shape, arrayed in steel,

<p><b>Caros or Carausius</b>, a Roman captain, native of Belgic Gaul. The
emperor Maximian employed Caros to defend the coast of Gaul against the
Franks and Saxons. He acquired great wealth and power, but fearing to
excite the jealousy of Maximian, he sailed for Britain, where (in A.D.
287) he caused himself to be proclaimed emperor. Caros resisted all
attempts of the Romans to dislodge him, so that they ultimately
acknowledged his independence. He repaired Agricola's wall to obstruct
the incursions of the Caledonians, and while he was employed on this
work was attacked by a party commanded by Oscar, son of Ossian and
grandson of Fingal. &quot;The warriors of Caros fled, and Oscar remained like
a rock left by the ebbing sea.&quot;&mdash;Ossian, <i>The War of Caros</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carpath'ian Wizard</b> (<i>The</i>), Proteus (2 <i>syl</i>.), who lived in the

<p><b>Carpet</b> (<i>Prince Housain's</i>), a magic carpet, to all appearances
quite worthless, but it would transport any one who sat on it to any
part of the world in a moment. This carpet is sometimes called &quot;the
magic carpet of Tangu,&quot; because it came from Tangu, in Persia.&mdash;<i>Arabian
Nights</i> (&quot;Prince Ahmed&quot;).</p>

<p><i>Carpet</i> (<i>Solomon's</i>). Solomon had a green silk carpet, on which his
throne was set. This carpet was large enough for all his court to stand
on; human beings stood on the right side of the throne, and spirits on
the left. When Solomon wished to travel he told the wind where to set
him down, and the carpet with all its contents rose into the air and
alighted at the proper place. In hot weather the birds of the air, with
outspread wings, formed a canopy over the whole party.&mdash;Sale, <i>Kor&acirc;n</i>,

<p><b>Carpil'lona</b> (<i>Princess</i>), the daughter of Subli'mus king of the
Peaceable Islands. Sublimus, being dethroned by a usurper, was with his
wife, child, and a foundling boy thrown into a dungeon, and kept there
for three years. The four captives then contrived to escape; but the
rope which held the basket in which Carpillona was let down snapped
asunder, and she fell into the lake. Sublimus and the other two lived in
retirement as a shepherd family, and Carpillona, being rescued by a
fisherman, was brought up by him as his daughter. When the &quot;Humpbacked&quot;
Prince dethroned the usurper of the Peaceable Islands, Carpillona was
one of the captives, and the &quot;Humpbacked&quot; Prince wanted to make her his
wife; but she fled in disguise, and came to the cottage home of
Sublimus, where she fell in love with his foster-son, who proved to be
half-brother of the &quot;Humpbacked&quot; Prince. Ultimately, Carpillona married
the foundling, and each succeeded to a kingdom.&mdash;Comtesse D'Aunoy,

conspicuous figure.</p>

<p><b>Carras'co</b> (<i>Samson</i>), son of Bartholomew Carrasco. He is a
licentiate of much natural humor, who flatters don Quixote, and
persuades him to undertake a second tour.</p>

witchcraft. To Rev. Cotton Mather's narrative of her crimes and

Richard Carstone is a &quot;handsome youth, about nineteen, of ingenuous
face, and with a most engaging laugh.&quot; He marries his cousin Ada, and
lives in hope that the suit will soon terminate and make him rich. In
the meantime he tries to make two ends meet, first by the profession of
medicine, then by that of law, then by the army; but the rolling stone
gathers no moss, and the poor fellow dies of the sickness of hope
deferred.&mdash;C. Dickens, <i>Bleak House</i> (1853).</p>

saying &quot;Get on! Faster, Jesus!&quot; Whereupon the Man of Sorrows replied, &quot;I
am going fast, Cartaphilus; but tarry thou till I come again.&quot; After the
crucifixion, Cartaphilus was baptized by the same Anani'as who baptized
Paul, and received the name of Joseph. At the close of every century he
falls into a trance, and wakes up after a time a young man about thirty
years of age.&mdash;<i>Book of the Chronicles of the Abbey of St. Allans</i>.</p>

up as censor or champion. He fancies his sister Monim'ia has lost her
honor, and calls her to task, but finds he is mistaken. He fancies her
guardian, old Acasto, has not been sufficiently watchful over her, and
draws upon him in his anger, but sees his folly just in time to prevent
mischief. He fancies Castalio, his sister's husband, has ill-treated
her, and threatens to kill him, but his suspicions are again altogether
erroneous. In fact, his presence in the house was like that of a madman
with fire-brands in a stack-yard.&mdash;Otway, <i>The Orphan</i> (1680).</p>

<p><b>Charalois</b>, son of the marshal of Burgundy. When he was twenty-eight
years old his father died in prison at Dijon, for debts contracted by
him for the service of the State in the wars. According to the law which
then prevailed in France, the body of the marshal was seized by his
creditors, and refused burial. The son of Charalois redeemed his
father's body by his own, which was shut up in prison in lieu of the
marshal's.&mdash;Philip Massinger, <i>The Fatal Dowry</i> (1632).</p>

<p>(It will be remembered that Milti'ad&ecirc;s, the Athenian general, died in

<p><b>Char'lemagne and His Paladins.</b> This series of romances is of French
origin, as the Arthurion is Welsh or British. It began with the
legendary chronicle in verse, called <i>Historia de Vita Carola Magni et
Rolandi</i>, erroneously attributed to Turpin archbishop of Rheims (a
contemporary of Charlemagne), but probably written two or three hundred
years later. The chief of the series are <i>Huon of Bordeaux, Guerin de
Monglave, Gaylen Rhetore</i> (in which Charlemagne and his paladins proceed
in mufti to the Holy Land), <i>Miles and Ames</i>,
<i>Jairdain de Blaves, Doolin de Mayence, Ogier le Danais</i>, and <i>Maugis
the Enchanter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Charlemagne and the Ring</i>. Pasquier says that Charles le Grand fell in
love with a peasant girl [Agatha], in whose society he seemed bewitched,
insomuch that all matters of state were neglected by him; but the girl
died, to the great joy of all. What, however, was the astonishment of
the court to find that the king seemed no less bewitched with the dead
body than he had been with the living, and spent all day and night with
it, even when its smell was quite offensive. Archbishop Turpin felt
convinced there was sorcery in this strange infatuation, and on
examining the body, found a ring under the tongue, which he removed.
Charlemagne now lost all regard for the dead body; but followed Turpin,
with whom, he seemed infatuated. The archbishop now bethought him of the
ring, which he threw into a pool at Aix, where Charlemagne built a
palace and monastery, and no spot in the world had such attractions for
him as Aix-la-Chapelle, where &quot;the ring&quot; was buried.&mdash;<i>Recherches de la
France</i>, vi. 33.</p>

<p><i>Charlemagne and Years of Plenty</i>. According to German legend,
Charlemagne appears in seasons of plenty. He crosses the Rhine on a
golden bridge, and blesses both corn-fields and vineyards.</p>

Thou standest, like imperial Charlemagne,<br>
Upon thy bridge of gold.<br>
<br>
Longfellow, <i>Autumn</i>.<br>

<p><i>Charlemagne not dead</i>. According to legend, Charlemagne was crowned and
armed in Odenberg <i>(Hesse)</i> or Untersberg, near Saltzburg, till the time
of antichrist, when he will wake up and deliver Christendom. (See
BARBAROSSA.)</p>

<p><i>Charlemagne's Nine Wives</i>: (1) Hamiltrude, a poor Frenchwoman, who bore
him several children. (2) Desidera'ta, who was divorced. (3) Hildegarde.

When the Dalecarlians rose in rebellion against him and chose Gustavus

according to lord Byron, the mutineers took refuge in the island of
Toobouai (one of the Society Islands). Here Torquil, one of the
mutineers, married Neuha, a native. After a time a ship was sent to
capture the mutineers. Torquil and Neuha escaped, and lay concealed in a
cave; but Christian, Ben Bunting, and Skyscrape were shot. This is not
according to fact, for Christian merely touched at Toobouai, and then,
with eighteen of the natives and nine of the mutineers, sailed for
Tahiti, where all soon died except Alexander Smith, who changed his name
to John Adams, and became a model patriarch.&mdash;Byron, <i>The Island</i>.</p>

Norway. She is sought in marriage by prince Arvi'da and by Gustavus
Vasa; but the prince abandons his claim in favor of his friend. After
the great battle, in which Christian is defeated by Gustavus, Christina
clings to her father, and pleads with Gustavus on his behalf. He is sent
back to Denmark, with all his men, without ransom, but abdicates, and
Sweden is erected into a separate kingdom.&mdash;H. Brooke, <i>Gustavus Vasa</i>

<p><b>Christine Dryfoos</b>, the undisciplined, showy daughter of a self-made
man in W. D. Howells's <i>A Hazard of New Fortunes</i> (1889).</p>

<p>She was self-possessed because she felt that a knowledge of her father's
fortune had got around, and she had the peace which money gives to
ignorance. She is madly in love with Beaton, whose attentions have
raised expectations he concluded not to fulfill. At their last meeting
she felt him more than life to her, and knew him lost, and the frenzy
that makes a woman kill the man she loves or fling vitriol to destroy
the beauty she cannot have for all hers possessed her lawless soul....
She flashed at him, and with both hands made a feline pass at the face
he bent towards her.</p>

Then, toddling to the chimney-place,<br>
He hung his little stocking there.<br>

<p><b>Chris'topher</b> <i>(St.)</i>, a saint of the Roman and Greek Churches, said
to have lived in the third century. His pagan name was Offerus, his body
was twelve ells in height, and he lived in the land of Canaan. Offerus
made a vow to serve only the mightiest; so, thinking the emperor was
&quot;the mightiest,&quot; he entered his service. But one day the emperor crossed
himself for fear of the devil, and the giant perceived that there was
one mightier than his present master, so he quitted his service for that
of the devil. After awhile. Offerus discovered that the devil was afraid
of the cross, whereupon he enlisted under Christ, employing himself in
carrying pilgrims across a deep stream. One day, a very small child was
carried across by him, but proved so heavy that Offerus, though a huge
giant, was well-nigh borne down by the weight. This child was Jesus, who
changed the giant's name to <i>Christoferus</i>, &quot;bearer of Christ.&quot; He died
three days afterwards, and was canonized.</p>

<p><b>Chroniclers</b> <i>(Anglo-Norman)</i>, a series of writers on British
history in verse, of very early date. Geffroy Gaimar wrote his
Anglo-Norman chronicle before 1146. It is a history in verse of the
Anglo-Saxon kings. Robert Wace wrote the <i>Brut d'Angleterre [i.e.,

<p><i>Chroniclers (Rhyming)</i>, a series of writers on English history, from
the thirteenth century. The most noted are: Layamon (called &quot;The English
Ennius&quot;) bishop of Ernleye-upon-Severn (1216). Robert of Gloucester, who
wrote a narrative of British history from the landing of Brute to the
close of the reign of Henry III. (to 1272). No date is assigned to the
coming of Brute, but he was the son of Silvius Aene'as (the third
generation from &AElig;neas, who escaped from Troy, B.C. 1183), so that the
date may be assumed to be B.C. 1028, thus giving a scope of 2300 years
to the chronicle. (The verse of this chronicle is eight and six
syllables displayed together, so as to form lines of fourteen syllables
each.) Robert de Brunne's chronicle is in two parts. The first ends with
the death of Cadwallader, and the second with the death of Edward I. The
earlier parts are similar to the Anglo-Norman chronicle of Wace. (The
verse is octo-syllabic.)</p>

whom, at her death, they were published. The first series contains <i>The

education had been conducted on money-grubbing principles; the first
word he was taught to spell was <i>gain</i>, and the second, <i>money</i>. He
poisons himself to save his neck from the gallows.</p>

<p>This fine young man had all the inclination of a profligate of the first
water, and only lacked the one good trait in the common catalogue of
debauched vices&mdash;open-handedness&mdash;to be a notable vagabond. But there
his griping and penurious habits stepped in.&mdash;Chap. xi.</p>

<p><i>Martin Chuzzlewit, sen.</i>, grandfather to the hero of the same name. A
stern old man, whose kind heart has been turned to gall by the dire
selfishness of his relations. Being resolved to expose Pecksniff, he
goes to live in his house, and pretends to be weak in intellect, but
keeps his eyes sharp open, and is able to expose the canting scoundrel
in all his deformity.</p>

<p><b>Cicero.</b> When the great Roman orator was given up by Augustus to the
revenge of Antony, it was a cobbler who conducted the sicarii to
Formiae, whither Cicero had fled in a litter, intending to put to sea.
His bearers would have fought, but Cicero forbade them, and one

<p><b>Cid</b> (<i>The</i>) = Seid or Signior, also called <b>Campeador</b>
[<i>Cam.pa'.dor</i>] or &quot;Camp hero.&quot; Rodrigue Diaz de Bivar was surnamed &quot;the
Cid.&quot; The great hero of Castille, he was born at Burgos, 1030, and died,
1099. He signalized himself by his exploits in the reigns of Ferdinand,
Sancho II., and Alphonso VI. of Leon and Castille. In the wars between
Sancho II. and his brother (Alphonso VI.), he sided with the former;
and, on the assassination of Sancho, was disgraced, and quitted the
court. He then assembled his vassals and marched against the Moors, whom
he conquered in several battles, so that Alphonso was necessitated to
recall him. Both Corneille and Guilhem de Cantro have admirable
tragedies on the subject; Ross Neil has an English drama called <i>The
Cid</i>; Sanchez, in 1775, wrote a long poem of 1128 verses, called <i>Poema
del Cid Campeador</i>. Southey, in his <i>Chronicle of the Cid</i> (1808), has
collected all that is known of this extraordinary hero. (It was <i>The
Cid</i> (1636) which gained for Corneille the title of &quot;Le Grand

Diego Rodriquez, died young.</p>

<p><i>The Cid's Horse</i> was Babieca [either <i>Bab.i.e'.keh</i> or <i>Ba.bee.'keh].</i>
It survived its master two years and a half, but no one was allowed to
mount it. Babieca was buried before the monastery gates of Valencia, and
two elms were planted to mark the spot.</p>

<p><b>Cid Hamet Benengeli</b>, the hypothetical author of <i>Don Quixote</i>. (See

<p>Spanish commentators have discovered this pseudonym to be only an
Arabian version of <i>Signior Cervantes. Cid, i.e.</i>, &quot;signior;&quot; <i>Hamet</i>, a
Moorish prefix; and <i>Ben-en-geli</i>, meaning &quot;son of a stag.&quot; So <i>cervato</i>
(&quot;a young stag&quot;) is the basis of the name Cervantes.</p>

<p><b>Cimmerian Darkness.</b> Homer places the Cimmerians beyond the Oceanus,
in a land of never-ending gloom; and immediately after Cimmeria, he
places the empire of Had&ecirc;s. Pliny (<i>Historia Naturalis</i>, vi. 14) places
Cimmeria near the Lake Avernus, in Italy, where &quot;the sun never

<p><b>Cinderella</b>, the heroine of a fairy tale. She was the drudge of the
house, &quot;put upon&quot; by her two elder sisters. While the elder sisters were
at a ball, a fairy came, and having arrayed the &quot;little cinder-girl&quot; in
ball costume, sent her in a magnificent coach to the palace where the
ball was given. The prince fell in love with her, but knew not who she
was. This, however, he discovered by means of a &quot;glass slipper&quot; which
she dropped, and which fitted no foot but her own.</p>

<p>(This tale is substantially the same as that of <i>Rhodopis and
Psammitichus</i> in &AElig;lian <i>[Var. Hist</i>., xiii., 32]. A similar one is also
told in Strabo <i>(Geog.</i> xvii).)</p>

<p>The <i>glass</i> slipper should be the <i>fur</i> slipper, <i>pantoufle en vair</i>,

<p><b>Cinq-Mars</b>, (<i>H. Coiffier de Ruze, marquis de</i>), favorite of Louis
XIII. and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Richelieu (1620-1642). Irritated by the
cardinal's opposition to his marriage with Marie de Gonzague, Cinq-Mars
tried to overthrow or to assassinate him. Gaston, the king's brother,
sided with the conspirator, but Richelieu discovered the plot, and
Cinq-Mars, being arrested, was condemned to death. Alfred de Vigny
published, in 1826, a novel (in imitation of Scott's historical novels)
on the subject, under the title of <i>Cinq-Mars.</i></p>

<p><b>Cinquecento</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), the fifteenth century of Italian notables.

(1475-1526), <i>poets</i>; Raphael (1483-1520), Titian (1480-1576), and
Michael Angelo (1474-1564), <i>painters</i>. These, with Machiavelli, Luigi
Alamanni, Bernardo Baldi, etc., make up what is termed the
&quot;Cinquecentesti.&quot; The word means the worthies of the '500 epoch, and it
will be observed that they all flourished between 1500 and the close of
that century. (See SEICENTA).</p>

<p><b>Cipan'go or Zipango</b>, a marvellous island described in the <i>Voyages</i>
of Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller. He described it as lying some
1500 miles from land. This island was an object of diligent search with
Columbus and other early navigators, but belongs to that wonderful chart
which contains the <i>El Dorado</i> of Sir Walter Raleigh, the <i>Utopia</i> of

carefully keep these ten guests from her cheeses: Gehazi, Lot's wife,
Argus, Tom Piper, Crispin, Lazarus, Esau, Mary Maudlin, Gentiles and
bishops. (1)Gehazi, because a cheese should never be a dead white,
like Gehazi the leper. (2) Lot's wife, because a cheese should not be too
salt, like Lot's wife. (3) Argus, because a cheese should not be full of
eyes, like Argus. (4) Tom Piper, because a cheese should not be &quot;hoven
and puffed,&quot; like the cheeks of a piper. (5) Crispin, because a cheese should not be
leathery, as if for a cobbler's use. (6) Lazarus, because a cheese
should not be poor, like the beggar Lazarus. (7) Esau, because a cheese
should not be hairy, like Esau. (8) Mary Maudlin, because a cheese
should not be full of whey, as Mary Maudlin was full of tears. (9)
Gentiles, because a cheese should not be full of maggots or gentils.
(10) Bishops, because a cheese should not be made of burnt milk, or milk
&quot;banned by a bishop.&quot;&mdash;T. Tusser, <i>Five Hundred Points of Good

Sir John Frugal, who became immensely wealthy, but retired from
business, and by a deed of gift transferred his wealth to his brother
Luke, whereby madam and her daughter were both dependent on him. During
her days of wealth the extravagance of Lady Frugal was unbounded, and
her dress costly beyond conception; but Luke reduced her state to that
of farmers' daughters in general. Luke says to her:</p>

You were served in plate;<br>

well-born husband as the last. The emptiness and vanity of what she
gained are well set forth in <i>An Ambitious Woman</i>, by Edgar Fawcett.

<p><b>Clandestine Marriage</b> <i>(The).</i> Fanny Sterling, the younger daughter
of Mr. Sterling, a rich city merchant, is clandestinely married to Mr.
Lovewell, an apprentice in the house, of good family; and Sir John

sister, and, not knowing of her marriage, proposes to her, but is
rejected. Fanny appeals to Lord Ogleby, who, being a vain old fop,
fancies she is in love with him, and tells Sterling he means to make her
a countess. Matters being thus involved, Lovewell goes to consult with
Fanny about declaring their marriage, and the sister, convinced that Sir
John is shut up in her sister's room, rouses the house with a cry of
&quot;Thieves!&quot; Fanny and Lovewell now make their appearance. All parties are
scandalized. But Fanny declares they have been married four months, and
Lord Ogleby takes their part. So all ends well.&mdash;G. Colman and D.

<p><b>Claus</b> <i>(Peter).</i> (See under K.)</p>

<p><i>Claus (Santa)</i>, a familiar name for St. Nicholas, the patron saint of
children. On Christmas Eve German children have presents stowed away in
their socks and shoes while they are asleep, and the little credulous
ones suppose that Santa Claus or Klaus placed them there.</p>

<p>St. Nicholas is said to have supplied three destitute maidens with
marriage portions by secretly leaving money with their widowed mother,
and as his day occurs just before Christmas, he was selected for the
gift-giver on Christmas Eve.&mdash;Yonge.</p>

<p><i>Claver'house</i> (3 <i>syl</i>.), John Graham of Claverhouse (Viscount Dundee),
a relentless Jacobite, so rapacious and profane, so violent in temper
and obdurate of heart, that every Scotchman hates the name. He hunted
the Covenanters with real vindictiveness, and is a by-word for barbarity
and cruelty (1650-1689).</p>

<p><b>Clavijo</b> <i>(Don)</i>, a cavalier who &quot;could touch the guitar to
admiration, write poetry, dance divinely, and had a fine genius for

was metamorphosed by Malambru/no into a crocodile of some unknown metal.
Don Quixote disenchanted him &quot;by simply attempting the adventure.&quot;&mdash;

order to disenchant the Infanta Antonoma'sia, her husband, and the
Countess Trifaldi (called the &quot;Dolori'da Due&ntilde;a&quot;). It was &quot;the very horse
on which Peter of Provence carried off the fair Magalone, and was
constructed by Merlin.&quot; This horse was called Clavileno or wooden Peg,
because it was governed by a wooden pin in the forehead.&mdash;Cervantes,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, II. iii. 4, 5 (1615).</p>

<p>There is one peculiar advantage attending this horse; he neither eats,
drinks, sleeps, nor wants shoeing.... His name is not Pegasus, nor
Bucephalus; nor is it Brilladoro, the name of the steed of Orlando
Furioso; neither is it Bayarte, which belonged to Reynaldo de Montalbon;
nor Bootes, nor Peritoa, the horses of the sun; but his name is
Clavileno the Winged.&mdash;Chap. 4.</p>

<p><i>Cl&eacute;ante</i> (2 <i>Syl.</i>), son of Har'pagon the miser, in love with Mariane
(3 <i>syl</i>.). Harpagon, though 60 years old, wished to marry the same
young lady, but Cl&eacute;ante solved the difficulty thus: He dug up a casket
of gold from the garden, hidden under a tree by the miser, and while
Harpagon was raving about the loss of his gold, Cl&eacute;ante told him he
might take his choice between Mariane and the gold. The miser preferred
the casket, which was restored to him, and Cl&eacute;ante married
Mariane.&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>L'Avar</i> (1667).</p>

noted for his filial piety. The Duke of Epire made a law that all men
who had attained the age of 80 should be put to death as useless
incumbrances of the commonwealth. Simonid&ecirc;s, a young libertine, admired
the law, but Cleanth&ecirc;s looked on it with horror, and determined to save
his father from its operation. Accordingly, he gave out that his father
was dead, and an ostentatious funeral took place; but Cleanth&ecirc;s retired
to a wood, where he concealed Leon'id&ecirc;s, while he and his wife waited on
him and administered to his wants.&mdash;<i>The Old Law</i> (a comedy of Philip

<p><i>Cleopatra and the Pearl</i>. The tale is that Cleopatra made a sumptuous
banquet, which excited the surprise of Antony; whereupon the queen took
a pearl ear-drop, dissolved it in a strong acid and drank the liquor to
the health of the triumvir, saying: &quot;My draught to Antony shall exceed

married Rodogune (3 <i>syl</i>.), daughter of Phraa'tes (3 <i>syl</i>.) the
Parthian king, and Cleopatra married Antiochus Sidet&ecirc;s, brother of
Demetrius. She slew her son Seleucus (by Demetrius) for treason, and as
this produced a revolt, abdicated in favor of her second son, Anti'ochus
VIII., who compelled her to drink poison which she had prepared for

slain by Clessammor; but Clessammor, being closely pressed by the
Britons, fled, and never again saw his bride. In due time a son was
born, called Carthon; but the mother died. While Carthon was still an
infant, Fingal's father attacked Balclutha, and slew Reuthama (Carthon's
grandfather). While the boy grew to manhood, he determined on vengeance;
accordingly he invaded Morven, the kingdom of Fingal, where Clessammor,

safety in a tree. The tiger took the babe and suckled it, after which
the eunuch carried the child to Egypt. In the siege of Jerusalem by the

Shall hurt my body, or by vain illusion<br>
Draw me to wander after idle fires,<br>
Or voices calling me in dead of night<br>
To make me follow and so tole me on<br>
Through mire and standing-pools, to find my ruin.<br>

by his two companions. The three then went to London to ask pardon of
the King, which at the Queen's intercession was granted. The King begged
to see specimens of their skill in archery, and was so delighted
therewith, that he made William a &quot;gentleman of fe,&quot; and the other two

she was changed into a sunflower, or rather a <i>tournesol</i>, which still

<p>The sunflower does not turn to the sun. On the same stem may be seen
flowers in every direction, and not one of them shifts the direction in
which it has first opened. T. Moore (1814) says:</p>

The sunflower turns on her god when he sets,<br>
The same look which she turned when he rose.<br>

<p>This may do in poetry, but it is not correct. The sunflower is so called
simply because the flower resembles a pictured sun.</p>

<p>Lord Thurlow (1821) adopted Tom Moore's error, and enlarged it:</p>

Madoc, the Welsh Prince, who had recently landed on the North American

interest in the White strangers, and she was not backward in showing it.
Then, when young Hoel was kidnapped, and confined in a cavern to starve
to death, Coatel visited him and took him food. Again, when Prince Madoc
was entrapped, she contrived to release him, and assisted the prince to
carry off young Hoel. After the defeat of the Az'tecas by the White
strangers, the chief priest declared that some one had proved a traitor,
and resolved to discover who it was by handing round a cup, which he
said would be harmless to the innocent, but death to the guilty. When it
was handed to Coatel, she was so frightened that she dropped down dead.

their looks, and therefore shut them up in two separate cells on the
banks of the Tweed. Colmal the daughter of Dunthalmo, who was in love
with Calthon, liberated him from his bonds, and they fled to Fingal to
crave aid on behalf of Colmar; but before succor could arrive, Dunthalmo

<p><b>Comedy of Errors,</b> by Shakespeare (1593), Aemilia, wife of &AElig;geon,
had two sons at a birth, and named both of them Antipholus. When grown
to manhood, each of these sons had a slave named Dromio, also
twin-brothers. The brothers Antipholus had been shipwrecked in infancy,
and being picked up by different vessels, were carried one to Syracuse
and the other to Ephesus. The play supposes that Antipholus of Syracuse
goes in search of his brother, and coming to Ephesus with his slave,
Dromio, a series of mistakes arises from the extraordinary likeness of
the two brothers and their two slaves. Adriana, the wife of the
Ephesian, mistakes the Syracusan for her husband; but he behaves so
strangely that her jealousy is aroused, and when her true husband
arrives he is arrested as a mad man. Soon after, the Syracusan brother
being seen, the wife, supposing it to be her mad husband broken loose,
sends to capture him; but he flees into a convent. Adriana now lays her
complaint before the duke, and the lady abbess comes into court. So both
brothers face each other, the mistakes are explained, and the abbess
turns out to be Aemilia, the mother of the twin brothers. Now, it so
happened that &AElig;geon, searching for his son, also came to Ephesus, and
was condemned to pay a fine or suffer death, because he, a Syracusan,
had set foot in Ephesus. The duke, however, hearing the story, pardoned
him. Thus &AElig;geon found his wife in the abbess, the parents their twin
sons, and each son his long-lost brother.</p>

gain possession of her, and drawing his knife, gives her the choice
between death and his wigwam.</p>

<p><b>Co'rah,</b> in Dryden's satire of <i>Absalom and Architophel</i>, is meant
for Dr. Titus Oates. As Corah was the political calumniator of Moses and
Aaron, so Titus Oates was the political calumniator of the pope and
English papists. As Corah was punished by &quot;going down alive into the
pit,&quot; so Oates was &quot;condemned to imprisonment for life,&quot; after being
publicly whipped and exposed in the pillory. North describes Titus Oates
as a very short man, and says, if his mouth were taken for the centre of
a circle, his chin, forehead, and cheekbones would fall in the
circumference.</p>

<p><b>Cormac I.,</b> son of Conar, a Cael, who succeeded his father as &quot;king
of Ireland,&quot; and reigned many years. In the latter part of his reign the
Fir-bolg (or Belgae settled in the south of Ireland), who had been
subjugated by Conar, rebelled, and Cormac was reduced to such
extremities that he sent to Fingal for aid. Fingal went with a large
army, utterly defeated Colculla &quot;lord of Atha,&quot; and re-established
Cormac in the sole possession of Ireland. For this service Cormac gave
Fingal his daughter Roscra'na for wife, and Ossian was their first son.
Cormac I. was succeeded by his son Cairbre; Cairbre by his son Artho;
Artho by his son Cormac II. (a minor); and Cormac II., (after a short
interregnum) by Ferad-Artho.&mdash;Ossian.</p>

<p><b>Cormac II.</b> (a minor), king of Ireland. On his succeeding his father
Artho on the throne, Swaran, king of Lochlin [<i>Scandinavia</i>] invaded
Ireland, and defeated the army under the command of Cuthullin. Fingal's
arrival turned the tide of events, for the next day Swaran was routed
and returned to Lochlin. In the third year of his reign Torlath
rebelled, but was utterly discomfited at lake Lago by Cuthullin, who,
however, was himself mortally wounded by a random arrow during the
persuit. Not long after this Cairbre rose in insurrection, murdered the
young king, and usurped the government. His success, however, was only
of short duration, for having invited Oscar to a feast, he treacherously
slew him, and was himself slain at the same time. His brother Cathmor
succeeded for a few days, when he also was slain in battle by Fingal,
and the Conar dynasty restored. Conar (first king of Ireland, a
Caledonian) was succeeded by his son Cormac I; Cormac I. was succeeded
by his son Cairbre; Cairbre by his son Artho; Artho by his son Cormac

the spear&quot; (i.e. a tournament). Argon, the eldest son of Annir, tilted
with him and overthrew him. This vexed Cormalo greatly, and during a
hunting expedition he drew his bow in secret and shot both Argon and his
brother Ruro. Their father wondered they did not return, when their dog
Runa came bounding into the hall, howling so as to attract attention.
Annir followed the hound, and found his sons both dead. In the mean time
his daughter was carried off by Cormalo. When Oscar, son of Ossian,
heard thereof, he vowed vengeance, went with an army to Lano,
encountered Cormalo, and slew him. Then rescuing the daughter, he took
her back to Inis-Thona, and delivered her to her father.&mdash;Ossian, <i>The

<p><b>Count of Narbonne</b>, a tragedy by Robert Jephson (1782). His father,
Count Raymond, having poisoned Alphonso, forged a will barring Godfrey's
right, and naming Raymond as successor. Theodore fell in love with
Adelaide, the count's daughter, but was reduced to this dilemma: if he
married Adelaide he could not challenge the count and obtain the
possessions he had a right to as grandson of Alphonso; if, on the other
hand, he obtained his rights and killed the count in combat, he could
not expect that Adelaide would marry him. At the end the count killed
Adelaide, and then himself. This drama is copied from Walpole's <i>Castle
of Otranto</i>.</p>

<p><b>Crawley</b> (<i>Sir Pitt</i>), of Great Gaunt Street, and of Queen's
Crawley, Hants. A sharp, miserly, litigious, vulgar, ignorant baronet,
very rich, desperately mean, &quot;a philosopher with a taste for low life,&quot;
and intoxicated every night. Becky Sharp was engaged by him to teach his
two daughters. On the death of his second wife, Sir Pitt asked her to
become lady Crawley, but Becky had already married his son, Captain
Rawdon Crawley. This &quot;aristocrat&quot; spoke of &quot;brass fardens,&quot; and was
unable to spell the simplest words, as the following specimen will
show:&mdash;&quot;Sir Pitt Crawley begs Miss Sharp and baggidge may be hear on
Tuseday, as I leaf ... to-morrow erly.&quot; The whole baronetage, peerage,
and commonage of England did not contain a more cunning, mean, foolish,
disreputable old rogue than Sir Pitt Crawley. He died at the age of
fourscore, &quot;lamented and beloved, regretted and honored,&quot; if we can
believe his monumental tablet.</p>

<p><i>Lady Crawley</i>. Sir Pitt's first wife was &quot;a confounded quarrelsome,
high-bred jade.&quot; So he chose for his second wife the daughter of Mr.
Dawson, iron-monger, of Mudbury, who gave up her sweetheart, Peter Butt,
for the gilded vanity of Crawleyism. This ironmonger's daughter had
&quot;pink cheeks and a white skin, but no distinctive character, no
opinions, no occupation, no amusements, no vigor of mind, no temper; she
was a mere female machine.&quot; Being a &quot;blonde, she wore draggled sea-green
or slatternly sky-blue dresses,&quot; went about slip-shod and in curl-papers
all day till dinner-time. She died and left Sir Pitt for the second time
a widower, &quot;to-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pitt Crawley</i>, eldest son of Sir Pitt, and at the death of his
father inheritor of the title and estates. Mr. Pitt was a most proper
gentleman. He would rather starve than dine without a dress-coat and
white neckcloth. The whole house bowed down to him; even Sir Pitt
himself threw off his muddy gaiters in his son's presence. Mr. Pitt
always addressed his mother-in-law with &quot;most powerful respect,&quot; and
strongly impressed her with his high aristocratic breeding. At Eton he
was called &quot;Miss Crawley.&quot; His religious opinions were offensively
aggressive and of the &quot;evangelical type.&quot; He even built a meeting-house
close by his uncle's church. Mr. Pitt Crawley came into the large
fortune of his aunt, Miss Crawley, married Lady Jane Sheepshanks,
daughter of the Countess of Southdown, became an M.P., grew money-loving
and mean, but less and less &quot;evangelical&quot; as he grew great and wealthy.</p>

<p><i>Captain Rawdon Crawley</i>, younger brother of Mr. Pitt Crawley. He was in
the Dragoon Guards, a &quot;blood about town,&quot; and an adept in boxing,
rat-hunting, the fives-court, and four-in-hand driving. He was a young
dandy, six feet high, with a great voice, but few brains. He could swear
a great deal, but could not spell. He ordered about the servants, who
nevertheless adored him; was generous, but did not pay his tradesmen; a
Lothario, free and easy. His style of talk was, &quot;Aw, aw; Jave-aw;
Grad-aw; it's a confounded fine segaw-aw&mdash;confounded as I ever smoked.
Gad-aw.&quot; This military exquisite was the adopted heir of Miss Crawley,
but as he chose to marry Becky Sharp, was set aside for his brother
Pitt. For a time Becky enabled him to live in splendor &quot;upon nothing a
year,&quot; but a great scandal got wind of gross improprieties between Lord
Steyne and Becky, so that Rawdon separated from his wife, and was given
the governorship of Coventry Isle by Lord Steyne. &quot;His Excellency
Colonel Rawdon Crawley died in his island of yellow fever, most deeply
beloved and deplored,&quot; and his son Rawdon inherited his uncle's title
and the family estates.</p>

<p><i>The Rev. Bute Crawley</i>, brother of Sir Pitt. He was a &quot;tall, stately,
jolly, shovel-hatted rector.&quot; &quot;He pulled stroke-oar in the Christ Church
boat, and had thrashed the best bruisers of the town. The Rev. Bute
loved boxing-matches, races, hunting, coursing, balls, elections,
regattas, and good dinners; had a fine singing voice, and was very
popular.&quot; His wife wrote his sermons for him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bute Crawley</i>, the rector's wife, was a smart little lady,

a mediaeval creation. Pope says her story was the invention of Lollius
the Lombard, historiographer of Urbino, in Italy. Cressida betroths
herself to Troilus, a son of Priam, and vows eternal fidelity. Troilus
gives the maiden a <i>sleeve</i>, and she gives her Adonis a <i>glove</i>, as a
love-knot. Soon after this betrothal an exchange of prisoners is made,

as a love-token.</p>

Cyrus, king of Persia. Cyrus commanded a huge funeral pile to be erected
upon which Croesus and fourteen Lydian youths were to be chained and
burnt alive. When this was done, the discrowned king called on the name
of Solon, and Cyrus asked why he did so. &quot;Because he told me to call no
one happy till death.&quot; Cyrus, struck with the remark, ordered the fire
of the pile to be put out, but this could not be done. Croesus then
called on Apollo, who sent a shower which extinguished the flames, and
he with his Lydians came from the pile unharmed.</p>

Atys, would be slain by an iron instrument, and used every precaution to
prevent it, but to no purpose; for one day Atys went to chase the wild

the battle of Dunbar; on 3rd September, 1651, he won the battle of
Worcester; and on 3rd September, 1658, he died. It is not, however, true
that he was born on 3rd September, as many affirm, for his birthday was

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg"> Similarly, the tomb of Am'asis, king of Egypt, was broken open by

<p>The dead body of Admiral Coligny [<i>Co.leen.ye</i>] was similarly insulted

<p><b>Crop</b> <i>(George)</i>, an honest, hearty farmer, who has married a second

especially are noteworthy. Crop tells his wife he hopes that better

for dinner every Sunday.&quot; The wife replies, &quot;It shall be lamb.&quot; &quot;But I
say it shall be pork.&quot; &quot;I hate pork, I'll have lamb.&quot; &quot;Pork, I tell
you.&quot; &quot;I say lamb.&quot; &quot;It shan't be lamb, I will have pork.&quot; The other
quarrel arises from Crop's having left the door open, which he asks his
wife civilly to shut. She refuses, he commands; she turns obstinate, he
turns angry; at length they agree that the person who first speaks shall
shut the door. Dorothy speaks first, and Crop gains the victory.&mdash;P.

&quot;poor gentleman,&quot; he offers her &quot;a house in town, the run of his estate
in the country, a chariot, two footmen, and &pound;600 a year;&quot; but the

vanished into thin air.</p>

<p><i>Croquemitaine</i> is a romance in three parts; the first part is a

daughter of a rich stockbroker. Francis pays court to the father, and
obtains his consent; Harry to the mother, and obtains her consent; and
George to the daughter, whose consent he obtains, and the two elder

Crothar carried off Conla'ma, daughter of Cathmin, a chief of the Cael
or Caledonians, who had colonized the <i>northern</i> parts of Ireland and
held their court in Ulster. As Conlama was betrothed to Turloch, a Cael,
he made an irruption into Connaught, slew Cormul, but was himself slain
by Crothar, Cormul's brother. The feud now became general, &quot;Blood poured
on blood, and Erin's clouds were hung with ghosts.&quot; The Cael being
reduced to the last extremity, Trathel (the grandfather of Fingal) sent
Conar (son of Trenmor) to their relief. Conar, on his arrival in Ulster,
was chosen king, and the Fir-bolg being subdued, he called himself &quot;the
King of Ireland.&quot;&mdash;Ossian, <i>Temora</i>, ii.</p>

<p><i>Crothar</i>, vassal king of Croma (in Ireland), held under Artho,
over-lord of all Ireland. Crothar, being blind with age, was attacked by
Rothmar, chief of Tromlo, who resolved to annex Croma to his own
dominion. Crotha sent to Fingal for aid, and Fingal sent his son Ossian
with an army; but before he could arrive Fovar-Gormo, a son of Crothar,
attacked the invader, but was defeated and slain. When Ossian reached
Ulster, he attacked the victorious Rothmar and both routed the army and
slew the chief.&mdash;Ossian, <i>Croma</i>.</p>

wore on their arms. Tarpeia opened the gate, and the Sabines as they
passed threw on her their shields, saying, &quot;These are the ornaments worn

<p><b>Custance,</b> daughter of the Emperor of Rome, affianced to the Sultan
of Syria, who abjured his faith and consented to be baptized in order to
marry her. His mother hated this apostasy, and at the wedding breakfast
slew all the apostates except the bride. Her she embarked in a ship,
which was set adrift and in due time reached the British shores, where
Custance was rescued by the Lord-constable of Northumberland, who took
her home, and placed her under the care of his wife Hermegild. Custance
converted both the constable and his wife. A young knight wished to
marry her, but she declined his suit, whereupon he murdered Hermegild,
and then laid the bloody knife beside Custance, to make her suspected of
the crime. King Alia examined the case, and soon discovered the real
facts, whereupon the knight was executed, and the king married Custance.</p>

<p>The queen-mother highly disapproved of the match, and during the absence
of her son in Scotland embarked Custance and her infant boy in a ship,
which was turned adrift. After floating about for five years, it was
taken in tow by a Roman fleet on its return from Syria, and Custance
with her son Maurice became the guests of a Eoman Senator. It so

Toscar came from Ireland, and was hospitably entertained by Morni. On
the fourth day, he saw Cuthona out hunting, and carried her off by
force. Being pursued by Conlath, a fight ensued, in which both the young

king of Lochlin <i>[Scandinavia]</i>, and being ashamed to meet Fingal,
retired from the field gloomy and sad. Fingal having utterly defeated
Swaran, invited Cuthullin to the banquet, and partially restored his
depressed spirits. In the third year of Cormac's reign, Torlah, son of
Can'tela, rebelled. Cuthullin gained a complete victory over him at the

<p>ALMEYDA, the Portuguese Governor of India, had his legs and thighs
shattered in a similar way, and caused himself to be bound to the ship's
mast, that he might wave his sword to cheer on the combatants.</p>

<p>JAAFER, at the battle of Muta, carried the sacred banner of the prophet.
One hand being lopped off, he held it with the other; this also being

<p><b>Dalgetty</b> (<i>Dugald</i>,) of Drumthwacket, the union of the soldado with
the pedantic student of Mareschal College. As a soldier of fortune, he
is retained in the service of the Earl of Monteith. The Marquis of
Argyll (leader of the parliamentary army) tried to tamper with him in
prison, but Dugald siezed him, threw him down, and then made his escape,
locking the marquis in the dungeon. After the battle, Captain Dalgetty
was knighted. This &quot;Ritt-master&quot; is a pedant, very conceited, full of
vulgar assurance, with a good stock of worldly knowledge, a student of
divinity, and a soldier who lets his sword out to the highest bidder.
The character is original and well drawn.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>Legend of

<p><b>Damaris Wainright.</b> A woman richly endowed by Nature and fortune,
whose mother and brother have died insane. She comes to maidenly
maturity under the impression which strengthens into belief that madness
is her heritage. After long struggles she accepts the hand of one who
has striven steadily to combat what he considers a morbid conviction,
and makes ready for her marriage. When dressed for the ceremony she sits
down to await her bridegroom, and the image of herself in a tarnished
mirror suggests a train of melancholy musing that result in dementia.</p>

&quot;With a mad impulse to flee she sprang to her<br>
feet just as Lincoln knocked.... For an instant<br>
her failing reason struggled to consciousness<br>
as a drowning swimmer writhes a last time<br>
to the surface, and gasps a breath only to give it<br>
up in futile bubbles that mark the spot where he<br>
sank. With a supreme effort her vanquished<br>
will for a moment re-asserted itself. She knew<br>
her lover was at the door, and she knew also<br>
that the feet of doom had been swifter than those<br>
of the bridegroom.... She sprang forward<br>
and threw open the door.&quot;<br>

pierced to every corner of the old mansion.&quot;<br>

<p><b>Dam'ocles</b> (3 <i>syl</i>.), a sycophant, in the court of Dionys'ius <i>the
Elder</i>, of Syracuse. After extolling the felicity of princes, Dionysius
told him he would give him experimental proof thereof. Accordingly he
had the courtier arrayed in royal robes and seated at a sumptuous
banquet, but overhead was a sword suspended by a single horsehair, and
Damocles was afraid to stir, lest the hair should break and the sword
fall on him. Dionysius thus intimated that the lives of kings are
threatened every hour of the day.&mdash;Cicero.</p>

Delia why she looks so coldly on him.
She replies because of his attention to
Belvid&ecirc;ra. He says he paid these attentions
at her own request, &quot;to hide the
secret of their mutual love.&quot; Delia confesses
that his prudence is commendable,
but his acting is too earnest. To this he
rejoins that she alone holds his heart; and
Delia replies:</p>

But I believe, because I love.<br>

<p><b>Damon and Musido'ra,</b> two lovers who misunderstood each other.

but one day he saw her bathing, and his delicacy so charmed the maiden
that she at once accepted his proffered love.&mdash;Thomson, <i>The Seasons</i>
(&quot;Summer,&quot; 1727).</p>

<p><b>Da'mon and Pyth'ias.</b> Damon, a senator of Syracuse, was by nature
hot-mettled, but was schooled by Pythagore'an philosophy into a Stoic
coldness and slowness of speech. He was a fast friend of the republic,
and when Dionysius was made &quot;King&quot; by a vote of the senate, Damon
upbraided the betrayers of his country, and pronounced Dionysius a
&quot;tryant.&quot; For this he was seized, and as he tried to stab Dionysius, he
was condemned to instant death. Damon now craved respite for four hours
to bid farewell to his wife and child, but the request was denied him.
On his way to execution, his friend Pythias encountered him, and
obtained permission of Dionysius to become his surety, and to die in his
stead, if within four hours Damon did not return. Dionysius not only
accepted the bail, but extended the leave to six hours. When Damon
reached his country villa, Lucullus killed his horse to prevent his
return; but Damon, seizing the horse of a chance traveler, reached
Syracuse just as the executioner was preparing to put Pythias to death.
Dionysius so admired this proof of friendship, that he forgave Damon,
and requested to be taken into his friendship.</p>

<p><b>Darwin's Missing Link</b>, the link between the monkey and man.
According to Darwin, the present host of animal life began from a few
elemental forms, which developed, and by natural selection propagated
certain types of animals, while others less suited to the battle of life
died out. Thus, beginning with the larvae of ascidians (a marine
mollusc,) we get by development to fish lowly organized (as the
lancelet), thence to ganoids and other fish, then to amphibians. From
amphibians we get to birds and reptiles, and thence to mammals, among
which comes the monkey, between which and man is a MISSING LINK.</p>

<p><b>Daughter</b> (<i>The</i>), a drama by S. Knowles (1836). Marian, &quot;daughter&quot;
of Robert, once a wrecker, was betrothed to Edward, a sailor, who went
on his last voyage, and intended then to marry her. During his absence a
storm at sea arose, a body was washed ashore, and Robert went down to
plunder it. Marian went to look for her father and prevent his robbing
those washed ashore by the waves, when she saw in the dusk some one stab
a wrecked body. It was Black Norris, but she thought it was her father.
Robert being taken up Marian gave witness against him, and he was
condemned to death. Norris said he would save her father if she would
marry him, and to this she consented; but on the wedding day Edward
returned. Norris was taken up for murder, and Marian was saved.</p>

<p><b>Daughter with Her Murdered Father's Head.</b> Margaret Roper, daughter
of Sir Thomas More, obtained privately the head of her father, which had
been exposed for some days on London Bridge, and buried it in St.
Dunstan's Church, Canterbury (1835). Tennyson alludes to this in the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

Morn broadened on the borders of the dark,<br>
Ere I saw her who clasped in her last trance<br>
Her murdered father's head.<br>

<p>The head of the young earl of Derwent-water was exposed on Temple Bar in
1716. His wife drove in a cart under the the arch, and a man, hired for
the purpose, threw the young earl's head into the cart, that it might be
decently buried&mdash;Sir Bernard Burke Mdlle. de Sombreuil, daughter of the

Armart, Erath a rival lover having been rejected by her. One day,
disguised as an old grey-beard, Erath told Daura that he was sent to
conduct her to Armar, who was waiting for her. Without suspicion she
followed her guide, who took her to a rock in the midst of the sea, and
there left her. Her brother Arindal, returning from the chase, saw Erath
on the shore, and bound him to an oak; then pushing off the boat, went
to fetch back his sister. At this crisis Armar came up, and discharged
his arrow at Erath; but the arrow struck Arindal, and killed him. &quot;The
boat broke in twain,&quot; and Armar plunged into the sea to rescue his
betrothed; but a &quot;sudden blast from the hills struck him, and he sank to
rise no more.&quot; Daura was rescued by her father, but she haunted the
shore all night in a drenching rain. Next day &quot;her voice grew very
feeble; it died away; and spent with grief, she expired.&quot; Ossian, <i>Songs
of Selma</i>.</p>

to Menevia, in Pembrokeshire, where he founded twelve convents. In 577
the archbishop of Caerleon resigned his see to him, and St. David
removed the seat of it to Menevia, which was subsequently called St.
David's and became the metropolis of Wales. He died at the age of 146,
in the year 642. The waters of Bath &quot;owe their warmth and salutary

<p><i>Dawson (Jemmy).</i> Captain James Dawson
was one of the eight officers belonging
to the Manchester volunteers in the service
of Charles Edward, the young pretender.
He was a very amiable young man,
engaged to a young lady of family and
fortune, who went in her carriage to witness
his execution for treason. When the
body was drawn, <i>i.e.</i> embowelled, and the
heart thrown into the fire, she exclaimed,
&quot;James Dawson!&quot; and expired. Shenstone
has made this the subject of a tragic
ballad.</p>

Young Dawson was a gallant youth,<br>

and after marriage he turned a &quot;captious tyrant and a noisy sot.&quot; Poor
Phoebe drooped, &quot;pinched were her looks, as one who pined for bread,&quot;

<p>In the comedy from which this farce is taken, &quot;Mrs. Day&quot; was the
kitchen-maid in the family of Colonel Careless, and went by the name of
Gillian. In her exalted state she insisted on being addressed as &quot;Your
honor&quot; or &quot;Your ladyship.&quot;</p>

<p>Margaret Woffington [1718-1760], in &quot;Mrs. Day,&quot; made no scruples to

<p><b>Dedlock</b> <i>(Sir Leicester), bart</i>., who has a general opinion that
the world might get on without hills, but would be &quot;totally done up&quot;
without Dedlocks. He loves Lady Dedlock, and believes in her implicity.
Sir Leicester is honorable and truthful, but intensely prejudiced,
immovably obstinate, and proud as &quot;county&quot; can make a man; but his pride
has a most dreadful fall when the guilt of Lady Dedlock becomes known.</p>

<p><i>Lady Dedlock</i>, wife of Sir Leicester, beautiful, cold, and apparently
heartless; but she is weighed down with this terrible secret, that
before marriage she had had a daughter by Captain Hawdon. This
daughter's name is Esther [Summerson] the heroine of the novel.</p>

the concerns of others.&mdash;C. Dickens, <i>Bleak House</i> (1853).</p>

<p><b>Dee's Spec'ulum,</b> a mirror, which Dr. John Dee asserted was brought
to him by the angels Raphael and Gabriel. At the death of the doctor it
passed into the possession of the Earl of Peterborough, at Drayton; then
to Lady Betty Grermaine, by whom it was given to John, last duke of
Argyll. The duke's grandson (Lord Frederic Campbell) gave it to Horace
Walpole; and in 1842 it was sold, at the dispersion of the curiosities
of Strawberry Hill, and bought by Mr. Smythe Pigott. At the sale of Mr.
Pigott's library, in 1853, it passed into the possession of the late
Lord Londesborough. A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (p. 376, November 7,
1874) says, it &quot;has now been for many years in the British Museum,&quot;
where he saw it &quot;some eighteen years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>This magic speculum is a flat <i>polished mineral, like cannel coal</i>, of a
circular form, fitted with a handle.</p>

<p><b>Deerslayer</b> (<i>The</i>), the title of a novel by J.F. Cooper, and the
nickname of its hero, Natty or Nathaniel Bumppo. He is a model
uncivilized man, honorable, truthful, and brave, pure of heart and
without reproach.</p>

<p><b>Deerfield.</b> The particulars of the captivity of the Williams family
of Deerfield, (Mass.), are told by John Williams, the head of the
household. The Indians entered the town before dawn Feb. 29, 1703, broke
into the house, murdered two children and a servant and carried the rest
into the wilderness. Mrs. Williams being weak from a recent illness, was
killed on the journey.&mdash;John Williams, <i>The Redeemed Captive Returning
to Zion</i> (1707).</p>

<p><b>Defender of the Faith</b>, the title first given to Henry VIII, by Pope
Leo X., for a volume against Luther, in defence of pardons, the papacy,
and the seven sacraments. The original volume is in the Vatican, and
contains this inscription in the king's handwriting; <i>Anglorum rex
Henricus, Leoni X. mittit hoc opus et fidei testem et amiciti&aelig;</i>;
whereupon the pope (in the twelfth year of his reign) conferred upon
Henry, by bull, the title &quot;Fidei Defensor,&quot; and commanded all Christians
so to address him. The original bull was preserved by Sir Robert Cotton,
and is signed by the pope, four bishop-cardinals, fifteen
priest-cardinals, and eight deacon-cardinals. A complete copy of the
bull, with its seals and signatures, may be seen in Selden's <i>Titles of
Honor</i>, v. 53-57 (1672).</p>

<p>Chilled with terror, we concluded that the Deggial, with his
exterminating angels, had sent forth their plagues on the
earth.&mdash;W. Beckford, <i>Vathek</i> (1784).</p>

<p><b>Deird'ri,</b> an ancient Irish story similar to the <i>Dar-Thula</i> of
Ossian. Conor, king of Ulster, puts to death by treachery the three sons
of Usnach. This leads to the desolating war against Ulster, which
terminates in the total destruction of Eman. This is one of the three
tragic stories of the Irish, which are: (1) The death of the children of
Touran (regarding Tuatha de Danans); (2) the death of the children of
Lear or Lir, turned into swans by Aoife; (3) the death of the children
of Usnach (a &quot;Milesian&quot; story).</p>

<p><b>Dek'abrist,</b> a Decembrist, from <i>Dekaber</i>, the Russian for December.
It denotes those persons who suffered death or captivity for the part
they took in the military conspiracy which broke out in St. Petersburg
in December, 1825, on the accession of Czar Nicholas to the throne.</p>

<p><b>Dela'da,</b> the tooth of Buddah, preserved in the Malegawa temple at
Kandy. The natives guard it with the greatest jealousy, from a belief
that whoever possesses it acquires the right to govern Ceylon. When the
English (in 1815) obtained possession of this palladium, the natives
submitted without resistance.</p>

Though not as she with bow and quiver armed.<br>

<p><i>Paradise Lost</i>, ix. 338, etc. (1665).</p>

<p><i>Delia</i>, any female sweetheart. She is one of the shepherdesses in
Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i>. Tibullus, the Roman poet, calls his lady-love
&quot;Delia,&quot; but what her real name was is not certain.</p>

<p><i>Delia</i>, the lady-love of James Hammond's elegies, was Miss Dashwood,
who died in 1779. She rejected his suit, and died unmarried. In one of
the elegies the poet imagines himself married to her, and that they were
living happily together till death, when pitying maids would tell of
their wondrous loves.</p>

<p><b>Della Crusca School,</b> originally applied in 1582 to a society in
Florence, established to purify the national language and sift from it
all its impurities; but applied in England to a brotherhood of poets (at
the close of the last century) under the leadership of Mrs. Piozzi. This
school was conspicuous for affectation and high-flown panegyrics on each
other. It was stamped out by Gifford, in <i>The Baviad</i>, in 1794, and <i>The
Moeviad</i>, in 1796. Robert Merry, who signed himself <i>Della Crusca</i>,
James Cobb, a farce-writer, James Boswell (biographer of Dr. Johnson),
O'Keefe, Morton, Reynolds, Holcroft, Sheridan, Colman the younger, Mrs.
H. Cowley, and Mrs. Robinson were its best exponents.</p>

<p><b>Del'phine,</b> (2 <i>syl.</i>), the heroine and title of a novel by Mde. de
Sta&euml;l. Delphine is a charming character, who has a faithless lover, and
dies of a broken heart. This novel, like <i>Corinne</i>, was written during
her banishment from France by Napoleon I., when she travelled in
Switzerland and Italy. It is generally thought that &quot;Delphine&quot; was meant
for the authoress herself (1802).</p>

<p><b>Delphine Classics</b> (<i>The</i>), a set of Latin classics edited in France
for the use of the grand dauphin (son of Louis XIV.). Huet was chief
editor, assisted by Montausier and Bossuet. They had thirty-nine

Denevoir, the seat of the Demetian king.<br>

<p>Drayton, <i>Polyolbion</i>, v. (1612).</p>

<p><b>Deme'trius,</b> a young Athenian, to whom Egeus (3 <i>syl</i>.) promised his
daughter Hermia in marriage. As Hermia loved Lysander, she refused to
marry Demetrius, and fled from Athens with Lysander. Demetrius went in
quest of her, and was followed by Helena, who doted on him. All four
fell asleep, and &quot;dreamed a dream&quot; about the fairies. On waking,
Demetrius became more reasonable. He saw that Hermia disliked him, but
that Helena loved him sincerely, so he consented to forego the one and
take to wife the other. When Egeus, the father of Hermia, found out how
the case stood, he consented to the union of his daughter with
Lysander.&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> (1592).</p>

<p><i>Deme'trius</i>, in <i>The Poetaster</i>, by Ben Jonson, is meant for John
Marston (died 1633).</p>

<p><i>Deme'trius</i>, a citizen of Greece during the reign of Alexius
Comnenus.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>Count Robert of Paris</i> (time, Rufus).</p>

<p><b>Demiurgus</b>, that mysterious agent which, according to Plato, made
the world and all that it contains. The Logos or &quot;Word&quot; of St. John's
Gospel (ch. i. I) is the demiurgus of platonizing Christians.</p>

<p><b>Democ'ritos</b> (in Latin <i>Democritus</i>), the laughing or scoffing
philosopher, the Friar Bacon of his age. To &quot;dine with Democ'ritos&quot; is
to go without dinner, the same as &quot;dining with Duke Humphrey,&quot; or
&quot;dining with the cross-legged knights.&quot;</p>

<p>People think that we [<i>authors</i>] often dine with Democritos, but there
they are mistaken. There is not one of the fraternity who is not welcome
to some good table.&mdash;Lesage, <i>Gil Blas</i>, xii. 7 (1735).</p>

<p><b>Democritus Junior,</b> Robert Burton, author of <i>The Anatomy of

<p>Milton, <i>Vacation Exercise</i> (1627).</p>

<p><b>Dem'ogor'gon,</b> tyrant of the elves and fays, whose very name
inspired terror; hence Milton speaks of &quot;the dreaded name of Demogorgon&quot;
(<i>Paradise Lost</i>, ii. 965). Spenser says he &quot;dwells in the deep abyss
where the three fatal sisters dwell&quot; (<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iv. 2); but Ariosto
says he inhabited a splendid palace on the Himalaya Mountains.
Demogorgon is mentioned by Statius in the <i>Thebaid</i>, iv. 516.</p>

<p>He's the first-begotten of Be&euml;lzebub, with a face as terrible as
Demogorgon.&mdash;Dryden, <i>The Spanish Fryar</i>, v. 2 (1680).</p>

<p><b>Demon.</b> Increase Mather tells a long and circumstantial story of
<i>The Demon at William Morse His House</i>, time of visitation being 1679.
&quot;The true story of these strange disturbances is as yet not certainly
known,&quot; he says. &quot;Some (as has been hinted), did suspect Morse's wife to
be guilty of witchcraft.&quot;&mdash;Increase Mather, <i>An Essay for the Eecording
of Illustrious Providences</i> (1681). <b>Demoph'o&ocirc;n</b> (4 <i>syl.</i>) was
brought up by Dem&ecirc;ter, who anointed him with ambrosia and plunged him
every night into the fire. One day, his mother, out of curiosity,

her that her foolish curiosity had robbed her son of immortal youth.</p>

<p>This story is also told of Isis.&mdash;Plutarch, <i>De Isid. et

<p><b>Demos'thenes of the Pulpit.</b> Dr. Thomas Rennell, dean of
Westminster, was so called by William Pitt (1753-1840).</p>

<p><b>Dendin</b> (<i>Peter</i>), an old man, who had settled more disputes than
all the magistrates of Poitiers, though he was no judge. His plan was to
wait till the litigants were thoroughly sick of their contention, and
longed to end their disputes; then he would interpose, and his judgment
could not fail to be acceptable.</p>

<p><i>Tenot Dendin</i>, son of the above, but, unlike the father, he always
tried to crush quarrels in the bud; consequently, he never succeeded in
settling a single dispute submitted to his judgment.&mdash;Rabelais,
<i>Pantagruel</i>, in. 41 (1545).</p>

<p>(Racine has introduced the same name into his comedy called <i>Les

<p><b>Dennis</b> the hangman, one of the ringleaders of the &quot;No Popery
Riots;&quot; the other two were Hugh, servant of the Maypole inn, and the
half-witted Barnaby Rudge. Dennis was cheerful enough when he &quot;turned
off&quot; others, but when he himself ascended the gibbet he showed a most
grovelling and craven spirit.&mdash;C. Dickens, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> (1841).</p>

<p><i>Dennis (John)</i>, &quot;the best abused man in English literature.&quot; Swift
lampooned him; Pope assailed him in the <i>Essay on Criticism</i>; and
finally he was &quot;damned to everlasting fame&quot; in the <i>Dunciad</i>. He is

dreary house, with a testy housekeeper, and a timid little nephew-ward,
and spends many of his lonely hours in trying to decide if he loves Miss
Deborah Woodhouse the utilitarian, or aesthetic Miss Ruth. On his
death-bed, he gives an old daguerreotype of himself to Miss Ruth.</p>

&quot;Not that I have&mdash;have changed my mind,<br>

<p><b>D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont</b> (<i>Le Chevalier</i>), a person notorious for the
ambiguity of his sex; said to be the son of an advocate. His face was
pretty, without beard, moustache, or whiskers. Louis XV. sent him as a
woman to Russia on a secret mission, and he presented himself to the
czarina as a woman (1756). In the Seven Years' War he was appointed
captain of dragoons. In 1777 he assumed the dress of a woman again,
which he maintained till death (1728-1810).</p>

<p><b>Derby</b> (<i>Earl of</i>), third son of the Earl of Lancaster, and near
kinsman of Edward III. His name was Henry Plantagenet, and he died 1362.
Henry Plantagenet, earl of Derby, was sent to protect Guienne, and was
noted for his humanity no less than for his bravery. He defeated the
Comte de l'Isle at Bergerac, reduced Perigord, took the castle of
Auberoche, in Gascony, overthrew 10,000 French with only 1000, taking
prisoners nine earls and nearly all the barons, knights, and squires

<p><b>Derry Down Triangle</b> <i>(The)</i>, Lord Castlereagh; afterwards marquis
of Londonderry; so called by William Hone. The first word is a pun on
the title, the second refers to his lordship's oratory, a triangle being
the most feeble, monotonous, and unmusical of all musical instruments.
Tom Moore compares the oratory of Lord Castlereagh to &quot;water spouting
from a pump.&quot;</p>

<i>Q</i>. Why is a pump like viscount Castlereigh?<br>

believe that she loves Cassio too well. After a violent conflict between
love and jealousy, Othello smothers her with a bolster, and then stabs
himself.&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Othello</i> (1611.)</p>

<p>The soft simplicity of Desdemona, confident of merit and conscious of
innocence, her artless perseverance in her suit, and her slowness to
suspect that she can be suspected, are proofs of Shakespeare's skill in
human nature.&mdash;Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p><b>Desert Fairy</b> <i>(The)</i>. This fairy was guarded by two lions, that

money-lender, acting on the advice of Mordent, lodges the girl with Mrs.
Enfield, a crimp, where Lennox is introduced to her, and obtains
Mordent's consent to run away with her. In the interim Cheveril sees

soldier, is engaged to Louisa, but during his absence some rumors of
gallantry to his disadvantage reach the village, and to test his love,
Louisa in pretence goes with Simkin as if to be married. Henry sees the
procession, is told it is Louisa's wedding day, and in a fit of
desperation gives himself up as a deserter, and is condemned to death.
Lousia goes to the king, explains the whole affair, and returns with his
pardon as the muffled drums begin to beat.</p>

<p><i>Devil (The Printer's)</i>. Aldus Manutius, a printer in Venice to the holy
Church and the doge, employed a negro boy to help him in his office.
This little black boy was believed to be an imp of Satan, and went by
the name of the &quot;printer's devil.&quot; In order to protect him from
persecution, and confute a foolish superstition, Manutius made a public
exhibition of the boy, and announced that &quot;any one who doubted him to be
flesh and blood might come forward and pinch him.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Devil (Robert the)</i>, of Normandy; so called because his father was said

<p><b>Devil on Two Sticks</b>, (<i>The</i>), that is <i>Le Diable Boiteux</i>, by
Lesage (1707). The plot of this humorous satirical tale is borrowed from
the Spanish, <i>El Diabolo Cojuelo</i>, by Gueva'ra (1635). Asmode'us (<i>le
diable boiteux</i>) perches Don Cle'ofas on the steeple of St. Salvador,
and stretching out his hand, the roofs of all the houses open, and
expose to him what is being done privately in every dwelling.</p>

<p><i>Devil on Two Sticks (The)</i>, a farce by S. Foote; a satire on the
medical profession.</p>

<p><b>Devil to Pay</b>, (<i>The</i>), a farce by C. Coffey. Sir John Loverule has
a termagant wife, and Zackel Jobson, a patient grissel. Two spirits
named Nadir and Ab'ishog transform these two wives for a time, so that
the termagant is given to Jobson, and the patient wife to Sir John. When
my lady tries her tricks on Jobson, he takes his strap to her and soon
reduces her to obedience. After she is well reformed, the two are
restored to their original husbands, and the shrew becomes an obedient,
modest wife (died, 1745).</p>

<p><b>Devil's Age</b> (<i>The</i>). A wealthy man once promised to give a poor
gentleman and his wife a large sum of money if at a given time they
could tell him the devil's age. When the time came, the gentleman at his
wife's suggestion, plunged first into a barrel of honey and then into a
barrel of feathers, and walked on all fours. Presently up came his
Satanic majesty, and said, &quot;<i>X and x</i> years have I lived,&quot; naming the
exact number, &quot;yet never saw I an animal like this.&quot; The gentlemen had
heard enough, and was able to answer the question without
difficulty.&mdash;Rev. W. Webster, <i>Basque Legends</i>, 58 (1877).</p>

<p><b>Devil's Chalice</b> (<i>The</i>). A wealthy man gave a poor farmer a large
sum of money on this condition: at the end of a twelvemonth he was
either to say &quot;of what the devil made his chalice,&quot; or else give his
head to the devil. The poor farmer as the time came round, hid himself
in the crossroads, and presently the witches assembled from all sides.
Said one witch to another, &quot;You know that Farmer So-and-so has sold his
head to the devil, for he will never know of what the devil makes his
chalice. In fact I don't know myself.&quot; &quot;Don't you?&quot; said the other;
&quot;why, of the parings of finger-nails trimmed on Sundays.&quot;&mdash;The farmer
was overjoyed, and when the time came round was quite ready with his
answer.&mdash;Rev. W. Webster, <i>Basque Legends</i>, 71 (1877).</p>

<p><b>Devil's Dyke, Brighton</b> (<i>The</i>). One day, as St. Cuthman was walking
over the South Downs, and thinking to himself how completely he had
rescued the whole country from paganism, he was accosted by his sable
majesty in person. &quot;Ha, ha!&quot; said the prince of darkness; &quot;so you think
by these churches and convents to put me and mine to your ban, do you?
Poor fool! why, this very night will I swamp the whole land with the
sea.&quot; &quot;Forewarned is forearmed,&quot; thought St. Cuthman, and hies him to
sister Celia, superior of a convent which then stood on the spot of the
present Dyke House. &quot;Sister,&quot; said the saint, &quot;I love you well. This
night, for the grace of God, keep lights burning at the convent windows
from midnight to day-break, and let masses be said by the holy
sisterhood.&quot; At sundown came the devil with pickaxe and spade, mattock:
and shovel, and set to work in right good earnest to dig a dyke which
should let the waters of the seas into the downs. &quot;Fire and brim-stone!&quot;
&mdash;he exclaimed, as a sound of voices rose and fell in sacred song&mdash;&quot;Fire
and brim-stone! What's the matter with me?&quot; Shoulders, feet, wrists,
loins, all seemed paralyzed. Down went mattock and spade, pickaxe and
shovel, and just at that moment the lights at the convent windows burst
forth, and the cock, mistaking the blaze for daybreak, began to crow
most lustily. Off flew the devil, and never again returned to complete
his work. The small digging he effected still remains in witness of the
truth of this legend of the &quot;Devil's Dyke.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Devil's Parliament</b> (<i>The</i>), the parliament assembled by Henry VI.
at Conventry, 1459. So called because it passed attainders on the duke
of York and his chief supporters.</p>

<p><b>Devil Sacrament.</b> This blasphemous rite whereby those who would
practice witchcraft were initiated into the diabolical mysteries is
described by Deodat Lawson in 1704.</p>

<p>&quot;At their cursed supper they were said to have red bread and red drink,
and when they pressed an afflicted person to eat and drink thereof she
turned away her head and spit at it, and said, 'I will not eat, I will
not drink. It is blood.' ... Thus horribly doth Satan endeavor to have
his kingdom and administrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&quot;&mdash;Deodat Lawson, <i>Christ's Fidelity the only Shield against
Satan's Malignity</i> (1704).</p>

<p><b>Devonshire</b>, according to historic fable, is a corruption of
&quot;Debon's-share.&quot; This Debon was one of the companions of Brute, the
descendent of Aene'as. He chased the giant Coulin till he came to a pit
eight leagues across. Trying to leap this chasm, the giant fell
backwards and lost his life.</p>

... that ample pit, yet far renowned<br>
For the great leap which Debon did compel<br>
Coulin to make, being eight lugs of ground,<br>
Into the which retourning back he fell ...<br>

Commentators say the wall was built in this<br>
manner: The workman dug till they found<br>
water; and having laid the foundation of stone<br>
and melted brass, they built the superstructure<br>
of large pieces of iron, between which they<br>
packed wood and coal, till the whole equalled<br>
the height of the mountains [<i>of Armenia</i>]. Then<br>
setting fire to the combustibles, and by the use of<br>
bellows, they made the iron red hot, and poured<br>
molten brass over to fill up the interstices.<br>

<p><b>Dimmesdale</b> <i>(Arthur).</i> Master Prynne, an English physician living
in Amsterdam, having determined to join the Massachusetts Colony, sent
his young wife Hester before him to await his coming. He was detained
two years, and on reaching Boston, the first sight that met his eyes was
his wife standing in the pillory with a young babe in her arms and with
the letter A, the mark of her shame, embroidered in scarlet on her
breast. A young clergyman, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, regarded by
all the people as a saint, too good for earth, was earnestly exhorting
her to declare the name of the child's father, but she steadfastly
refused, and was sent back to prison. Prynne who had heard in Amsterdam
rumors of his wife's infidelity, both to discover her betrayer and to
hide his own relation to his wife, had taken the name of Roger
Chillingworth, and with eyes sharpened by jealousy and wounded pride,
soon discovered that his wife's lover was no other than Dimmesdale
himself. As a physician and under the guise of friendship he attached
himself to the minister, and pursued his ghastly search for the secret
cause that was eating away his life. How it all ended is shown in that
wonderful book where, as in a Greek drama, the fates of Arthur
Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne, Roger Chillingworth, and the love-child,
Little Pearl, are traced in lines of fire.&mdash;Nathaniel Hawthorne, <i>The

constructed during the day was swallowed up in the earth during the
night. Merlin (then called Ambrose or Embres-Guletic) discovered the
cause to be &quot;two serpents at the bottom of a pool below the foundation
of the works.&quot; These serpents were incessantly struggling with each
other; one was white, and the other red. The white serpent at first
prevaled, but ultimately the red one chased the other out of the pool.
The red serpent, he said, meant the Britons, and the white one the
Saxons. At first the Saxons (or <i>white serpent</i>) prevailed, but in the
end &quot;our people&quot; <i>the red serpent</i> &quot;shall chase the Saxon race beyond
the sea.&quot;&mdash;Nennius, <i>History of the Britons</i> (842).</p>

and buried at St. Alban's. It was generally thought that he was buried
in the nave of St. Paul's Cathedral; but the monument supposed to be
erected to the duke was in reality that of John Beauchamp. Loungers, who
were asked if they were not going home to dinner, and those who tarried
in St. Paul's after the general crowd had left, were supposed to be so
busy looking for the duke's monument that they disregarded the dinner

the age of 63, and it was the <i>younger</i> Dionysius who was dethroned by

Andromach&ecirc; he would protect her son, and defy all Greece, if she would

<p><b>Divi'na Comme'dia,</b> the first poem of note ever written in the

into three parts: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Dante' called it a
<i>comedy</i>, because the ending is happy; and his countrymen added the word
<i>divine</i> from admiration of the poem. The poet depicts a vision, in
which he is conducted, first by Virgil (<i>human reason</i>,) through hell
and purgatory; and then by Beatrice (<i>revelation</i>), and finally by St.
Bernard, through the several heavens, where he beholds the Triune God.</p>

centre. (See INFERNO, 1300).</p>

<p>&quot;Purgatory&quot; is a mountain rising solitarily from the ocean on that side
of the earth which is opposite to us. It is divided into terraces, and
its top is the terrestrial paradise. (See PURGATORY, 1308).</p>

<p>From this &quot;top&quot; the poet ascends through the seven planetary heavens,
the fixed stars, and the &quot;primum mobile&quot; to the empyre'an or seat of

<p><b>Do'dona</b> in (Epiros), famous for the most ancient oracle in

pigeons endowed with the gift of human speech: one flew into Libya, and

scholarship of an Oxford pedant and a captain in the army, he gets both
to speak Greek before him. Gradus, the scholar, quotes two lines of
Greek, in which the <i>panta</i> occurs four times. &quot;Pantry!&quot; cries the old

The captain tries English fustian, and when Gradus maintained that the

&quot;as if I didn't know my own mother tongue!&quot; and gives his verdict in
favor of the captain.</p>

Huncamunca; but when Noodle announces that the red cow has devoured the

<p><b>Dolly.</b> The most bewitching of the Bohemian household described in

loving, she bears and smiles through the hardships and vicissitudes of
her lot until she loses (as she thinks) the love and trust of &quot;Griff,&quot;
to whom she had been betrothed for years. Only his return and penitence
save her from slipping out of a world that has few nobler women.</p>

<p><b>Dolly of the Chop-house</b> (Queen's Head Passage, Paternoster Row and
Newgate Street, London.) Her celebrity arose from the excellency of her
provisions, attendance, accommodation, and service. The name is that of
the old cook of the establishment.</p>

The broth reviving, and the bread was fair,<br>
The small beer grateful and as pepper strong,<br>
The beaf-steaks tender, and the pot-herbs young.<br>

<p><b>Dol'on,</b> &quot;a man of subtle wit and wicked mind,&quot; father of Guizor
(groom of Pollent&ecirc; the Saracen, lord of &quot;Parlous Bridge&quot;). Sir Ar'tegal,
with scant ceremony, knocks the life out of Guizor, for demanding of him
&quot;passage-penny&quot; for crossing the bridge. Soon afterwards, Brit'omart and
Talus rest in Dolon's castle for the night, and Dolon, mistaking
Britomart for Sir Artegal, sets upon her in the middle of the night, but
is overmastered. He now runs with his two surviving sons to the bridge,
to prevent the passage of Britomart and Talus; but Britomart runs one of
them through with her spear, and knocks the other into the
river.&mdash;Spenser <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i> v. 6 (1596).</p>

<p><b>Dol'on and Ulysses.</b> Dolon undertook to enter the Greek camp and
bring word back to Hector an exact account of everything. Accordingly he
put on a wolf's skin and prowled about the camp on all fours. Ulysses
saw through the disguise, and said to Diomed, &quot;Yonder man is from the
host ... we'll let him pass a few paces, and then pounce on him
unexpectedly.&quot; They soon caught the fellow, and having &quot;pumped&quot; out of
him all about the Trojan plans, and the arrival of Rhesus, Diomed smote
him with his falchion on the mid-neck and slew him. This is the subject
of bk. x. of the <i>Iliad</i> and therefore this book is called &quot;Dolonia&quot;
(&quot;the deeds of Dolon&quot; or &quot;Dolophon'ia&quot;, &quot;Dolon's murder&quot;).</p>

charge of &quot;seven wise masters.&quot; When grown to man's estate, Lucien's
step-mother made improper advances to him, which he repulsed, and she
accused him to the king of insulting her. By astrology the prince
discovered that if he could tide over seven days his life would be
saved; so the wise masters amused the king with seven tales, and the
king relented. The prince himself then told a tale which embodied his
own history; the eyes of the king were opened, and the queen was
condemned to death.&mdash;<i>Sandabar's Parables</i> (French version).</p>

<p><b>Dombey</b> (<i>Mr.</i>), a purse-proud, self-contained London merchant,
living on Portland place, Bryanstone Square, with offices in the City.
His god was wealth; and his one ambition was to have a son, that the
firm might be known as &quot;Dombey and Son.&quot; When Paul was born, his
ambition was attained, his whole heart was in the boy, and the loss of
the mother was but a small matter. The boy's death turned his heart to
stone, and he treated his daughter Florence not only with utter
indifference, but as an actual interloper. Mr. Dombey married a second
time, but his wife eloped with his manager, James Carker, and the proud
spirit of the merchant was brought low.</p>

<p><i>Paul Dombey</i>, son of Mr. Dombey; a delicate, sensitive little boy,
quite unequal to the great things expected of him. He was sent to Dr.
Blimber's school, but soon gave way under the strain of school
discipline. In his short life he won the love of all who knew him, and
his sister Florence was especially attached to him. His death is
beautifully told. During his last days he was haunted by the sea, and
was always wondering what the wild waves were saying.</p>

<p><i>Florence Dombey</i>, Mr. Dombey's daughter; a pretty, amiable, motherless
child, who incurred her father's hatred because she lived and throve
while her younger brother Paul dwindled and died. Florence hungered to
be loved, but her father had no love to bestow on her. She married
Walter Gay, and when Mr. Dombey was broken in spirit by the elopement of
his second wife, his grandchildren were the solace of his old age.&mdash;O.

<p><b>Dom-Daniel</b> originally meant a public school for magic, established
at Tunis; but what is generally understood by the word is that immense
establishment, near Tunis, under the &quot;roots of the ocean,&quot; established
by Hal-il-Mau'graby, and completed by his son. There were four entrances
to it, each of which had a staircase of 4000 steps; and magicians,
gnomes, and sorcerers of every sort were expected to do homage there at
least once a year to Zatana&iuml; [Satan]. Dom-Daniel was utterly destroyed
by Prince Habed-il-Rouman, son of the Caliph of Syria.&mdash;<i>Continuation of
the Arabian Nights</i> &quot;History of Maugraby.&quot;</p>

<p>Southey has made the destruction of Dom-Daniel the subject of his

<p><b>Dominick</b>, the &quot;Spanish fryar,&quot; a kind of ecclesiastical Falstaff. A
most immoral, licentious Dominican, who for money would prostitute even
the Church and Holy Scriptures. Dominick helped Lorenzo in his amour
with Elvi'ra the wife of Gomez.</p>

He is a huge, fat, religious gentleman ... big<br>
enough to be a pope. His gills are as rosy as a<br>

<p><b>Donatello</b>, a young Italian whose marvellous resemblance to the
Marble Faun of Praxiteles is the subject of jesting remark to three
American friends.</p>

&quot;So full of animal life as he was, so joyous<br>
in his deportment, so physically well-developed;<br>
he made no impression of incompleteness, of<br>
maimed or stinted, nature.&quot; Yet his friends<br>
&quot;habitually allowed for him, exacting no strict<br>
obedience to conventional rules, and hardly noticing<br>
his eccentricities enough to pardon them.&quot;<br>

<p>He loves Miriam, an American student, and resents the persecution of her
by a mysterious man&mdash;a nominal &quot;model&quot; who thrusts his presence upon her
at all inconvenient times. One night as he comes between Donatello and
Miriam as they lean on the parapet crowning the Tarpeian Rock, the
Italian throws him over the precipice and kills him. From that moment,
although he is not accused of the deed, the joyous faun becomes the
haunted man.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing will ever comfort me!&quot; he says
moodily to Miriam, when she would extenuate
his crime. &quot;I have a great weight here!&quot;
lifting her hand to his breast. Wild creatures,
once his loved companions, shun him as he, in
turn, shuns the face of man. He disappears
from the story, hand-in-hand with Miriam,
bound, it would seem, upon a penitential pilgrimage,
or to begin a new life in another
hemisphere.&mdash;Nathaniel Hawthorne, <i>The Marble
Faun</i> (1860).</p>

<p><b>Donation of Pepin.</b> When Pepin conquered Ataulf (Adolphus), the
exarchate of Ravenna fell into his hands. Pepin gave the pope both the
ex-archate and the republic of Rome; and this munificent gift is the
world-famous &quot;Donation of Pepin,&quot; on which rested the whole fabric of
the temporal power of the popes (A.D. 755). Victor Emmanuel, king of
Italy, dispossessed the pope of his temporal sovereignty, and added the
papal states to the united kingdom of Italy, over which he reigned

dead maiden received a supernatural vitality, but her cheeks were wan,
her lips livid, her eyes lustreless, and her lap-dog howled when it saw
her. Eberhard still resolved to marry her, and to church they went; but

<p>I. THE BLACK DOUGLASES (or senior branch). Each of these is called &quot;The
Black Douglas.&quot;</p>

<p><i>The Hardy</i>, William de Douglas, defender of Berwick (died 1302).</p>

(1424).</p>

<p>William Douglas, eighth earl, stabbed by James II., and then despatched
with a battle-axe by Sir Patrick Gray, at Stirling, February 13, 1452.
Sir Walter Scott alludes to this in <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>.</p>

<p>James Douglas, ninth and last earl (died 1488). With him the senior
branch closes.</p>

<p>II. THE RED DOUGLASES, a collateral branch.</p>

<p><i>Bell-the-Cat</i>, the great earl of Angus. He is introduced by Scott in
<i>Marmion</i>. His two sons fell in the battle of Flodden Field. He died in
a monastery, 1514.</p>

<p>Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, and grandson of &quot;Bell-the-Cat.&quot;
James Bothwell, one of the family, forms the most interesting part of
Scott's <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. He was the grandfather of Darnley, husband
of Mary Queen of Scots. He died 1560.</p>

<p>James Douglas, earl of Morton, younger-brother of the seventh earl of
Angus. He took part in the murder of Rizzio, and was executed by the
instrument called &quot;the maiden&quot; (1530-1581).</p>

<p>The &quot;Black Douglas,&quot; introduced by Sir W. Scott in <i>Castle Dangerous</i>,
is &quot;The Gud schyr James.&quot; This was also the Douglas which was such a
terror to the English that the women used to frighten their unruly
children by saying they would &quot;make the Black Douglas take them.&quot; He
first appears in <i>Castle Dangerous</i> as &quot;Knight of the tomb.&quot; The
following nursery rhyme refers to him:&mdash;</p>

Hush ye, hush, ye, little pet ye;<br>
Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye;<br>
The Black Douglas shall not get thee.<br>

<p>Sir W. Scott, <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>, i. 6.</p>

<p><i>Douglas</i>, a tragedy by J. Home (1757). Young Norval, having saved the
life of Lord Randolph, is given a commission in the army. Lady Randolph
hears of the exploit, and discovers that the youth is her own son by her
first husband, Lord Douglas. Glenalvon, who hates the new favorite,
persuades Lord Randolph that his wife is too intimate with the young
upstart, and the two surprise them in familiar intercourse in a wood.
The youth, being attacked, slays Glenalvon, but is in turn slain by Lord
Randolph, who then learns that the young man was Lady Randolph's son.
Lady Randolph, in distraction, rushes up a precipice and throws herself
down headlong, and Lord Randolph goes to the war then raging between
Scotland and Denmark.</p>

<p><i>Douglas (Archibald earl of</i>), father-in-law of Prince Robert, eldest
son of Robert III. of Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Margery of Douglas</i>, the earl's daughter, and wife of Prince Robert
duke of Rothsay. The duke was betrothed to Elizabeth, daughter of the

Scott, <i>Fair Maid of Perth</i> (time, Henry IV.).</p>

<p><i>Douglas (George)</i>, nephew of the regent Murray of Scotland, and
grandson of the lady of Lochleven. George Douglas was devoted to Mary
Queen of Scots.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>The Abbot</i> (time, Elizabeth).</p>

<p><b>Douglas and the Bloody Heart.</b> The heart of Bruce was entrusted to
Douglas to carry to Jerusalem. Landing in Spain, he stopped to aid the
Castilians against the Moors, and in the heat of battle cast the
&quot;heart,&quot; enshrined in a golden coffer, into the very thickest of the
foe, saying, &quot;The heart or death!&quot; On he dashed, fearless of danger, to
regain the coffer, but perished in the attempt. The family thenceforth
adopted the &quot;bloody heart&quot; as their armorial device.</p>

<p><b>Douglas Larder</b> (<i>The</i>). When the &quot;Good Sir James&quot; Douglas, in 1306,
took his castle by <i>coup de main</i> from the English, he caused all the
barrels containing flour, meal, wheat, and malt to be knocked in pieces
and their contents to be thrown on the floor; he then staved in all the
hogsheads of wine and ale upon this mass. To this he flung the dead
bodies slain and some dead horses. The English called this disgusting
mass &quot;The Douglas Larder.&quot; He then set fire to the castle and took
refuge in the hills, for he said &quot;he loved far better to hear the lark
sing than the mouse cheep.&quot;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg"><i>Wallace's Larder</i> is a similar phrase. It is the dungeon of
Ardrossan, in Ayrshire, where Wallace had the dead bodies of the

<p>That very clever actor Cherry (1769-1812), appeared in &quot;Sir Benjamin
Dove,&quot; and showed himself a master of his profession.&mdash;Boaden.</p>

<p><i>Lady Dove</i>, twice married, first to Mr. Searcher, king's messenger, and
next to Sir Benjamin Dove. She had a <i>tendresse</i> for Mr. Paterson. Lady
Dove was a terrible termagant, and when scolding failed used to lament
for &quot;poor dear dead Searcher, who&mdash;, etc., etc.&quot; She pulled her bow
somewhat too tight, and Sir Benjamin asserted his independence.</p>

brickdust.&quot; This vulgar and illiterate petty shopkeeper is raised to the
peerage under the title of &quot;The Right Hon. Daniel Dowlas, Baron
Duberly.&quot; But scarcely has he entered on his honors, when the
&quot;heir-at-law,&quot; supposed to have been lost at sea, makes his appearance
in the person of Henry Morland. The &quot;heir&quot; settles on Daniel Dowlas an
annuity.</p>

<p><i>Deborah Dowlas</i>, wife of Daniel, and for a short time Lady Duberly. She

he is a pear, he ought to behave as sich.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Dick Dowlas</i>, the son, apprenticed to an attorney at Castleton. A wild
young scamp, who can &quot;shoot wild ducks, fling a bar, play at cricket,

&quot;When Aurelius was king, there appeared a star at Winchester, of
wonderful magnitude and brightness, darting forth a ray at the end of
which was a flame in the form of a dragon.&quot; Uther ordered two golden
dragons to be made, one of which he presented to Winchester, and the
other he carried with him as a royal standard. Tennyson says that
Arthur's helmet had for crest a golden dragon.</p>

old metrical romances, especially on the old rhyming legend of Sir
Bevis. The ballad describes the dragon, its outrages, the flight of the
inhabitants, the knight choosing his armor, the damsel, the fight and
the victory. The hero is called &quot;More, of More Hall&quot; (<i>q. v</i>.)&mdash;Percy,

George killed the dragon; but the place assigned for this achievement in
the ballad given in Percy's <i>Reliques</i> is &quot;Sylene, in Libya.&quot; Another
legend gives Berytus <i>(Beyrut)</i> as the place of this encounter.</p>

<p><b>Dragon's Teeth.</b> The tale of Jason and &AElig;&ecirc;t&ecirc;s is a repetition of that

<p>In the tale of CADMUS, we are told the fountain of Arei'a (3 <i>syl</i>.) was
guarded by a fierce dragon. Cadmus killed the dragon, and sowed its
teeth in the earth. From these teeth sprang up armed men called
&quot;Sparti,&quot; among whom he flung stones, and the armed men fell foul of
each other, till all were slain excepting five.</p>

<p>In the tale of JASON, we are told that having slain the dragon, which
kept watch over the golden fleece, he sowed its teeth in the ground, and
armed men sprang up. Jason cast a stone into the midst of them,
whereupon the men attacked each other, and were all slain.</p>

<p><b>Drama.</b> The earliest European drama since the fall of the Western
empire appeared in the middle of the fifteenth century. It is called <i>La
Celestina</i>, and is divided into twenty-one acts. The first act, which
runs through fifty pages, was composed by Rodridgo Cota; the other
twenty are ascribed to Ferdinando de Rojas. The whole was published in
1510.</p>

<p>The earliest English drama is entitled <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, a comedy
by Nicholas Udal (before 1551, because mentioned by T. Wilson, in his
<i>Rule of Reason</i>, which appeared in 1551).</p>

<p>The second English drama was <i>Gammer Gurton's Needle</i>, by Mr. S. Master
of Arts. Warton, in his <i>History of English Poetry</i> (iv. 32), gives 1551
as the date of this comedy; and Wright, in his <i>Historia Histrionica</i>,
says it appeared in the reign of Edward VI., who died 1553. It is
generally ascribed to Bishop Still, but he was only eight years old in
1551.</p>

coined by William Wood, to whom George I. had given a patent. These
letters (1724) stamped out this infamous job and caused the patent to be
cancelled. The patent was obtained by the Duchess of Kendall (mistress
of the king), who was to share the profits.</p>

<p><b>Druses</b> (<i>Return of the</i>). The Druses, a semi-Mohammedan sect of
Syria, being attacked by Osman, take refuge in one of the Spor'ad&ecirc;s, and
place themselves under the protection of the Knights of Rhodes. These
knights slay their sheiks and oppress the fugitives. In the sheik
massacre, Dja'bal is saved by Ma&auml;'ni, and entertains the idea of
revenging his people and leading them back to Syria. To this end he
gives out that he is Hakeem, the incarnate god, returned to earth, and
soon becomes the leader of the exiled Druses. A plot is formed to murder
the prefect of the isle, and to betray the Island to Venice, if Venice
will supply a convoy for their return. An'eal (2 <i>syl</i>.), a young woman
stabs the prefect, and dies in bitter disappointment when she discovers
that Djabal is a mere impostor. Djabal stabs himself when his imposition
is made public, but Loys, (2 <i>syl</i>.) a Brenton count, leads the exiles
back to Lebanon. Robert Browning.&mdash;<i>The Return of the Druses</i>.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg"> Historically, the Druses, to the number of 160,000 or 200,000,
settled in Syria, between Djebail and Sa&iuml;de, but their original seat was
Egypt. They quitted Egypt from persecution, led by Dara'zi or Durzi,
from whom the name Druse (1 <i>syl</i>.) is derived. The founder of the sect
was the hak&ecirc;m B'amr-ellah (eleventh century), believed to be incarnate
deity, and the last prophet who communicated between God and man. From
this founder the head of the sect was called the <i>hak&ecirc;m</i>, his residence
being Deir-el-Kamar. During the thirteenth or fourteenth century the
Druses were banished from Syria, and lived in exile in some of the
Sporad&ecirc;s but were led back to Syria early in the fifteenth century by
Count Loys de Duex, a new convert. Since 1588 they have been tributaries
of the sultan.</p>

Louisa is in love with Don Antonio, a poor nobleman of Seville; but her
father resolves to give her in marriage to Isaac Mendoza, a rich
Portuguese Jew. As Louisa will not consent to her father's arrangement,
he locks her up in her chamber, and turns the duenna out of doors, but

Sansjoy under the care of Escula'pius in the infernal regions (canto 4).
The Red Cross Knight leaves the palace of Lucifera, and Duessa induces
him to drink of the &quot;Enervating Fountain;&quot; Orgoglio then attacks him,

Nations, and Religion thought Duessa guilty, but Pity, Danger, Nobility
of Birth, and Grief pleaded in her behalf. Zeal then charges the
prisoner with murder, sedition, adultery, and lewd impiety; whereupon
the sentence of the court is given against her. Queen Mercilla, being

[<i>sic</i>] doted on Marcelia his young bride, who amply returned his love.
Francesco, Sforza's favorite, being left lord protector of Milan during
a temporary absence of the duke, tried to corrupt Marcelia; but failing
in this, accused her to Sforza of wantonness. The duke, believing his
favorite, slew his beautiful young bride. The cause of Francesco's

<p><b>Dun'ciad</b> (&quot;<i>the dunce epic</i>&quot;), a satire by Alexander Pope&mdash;written
to revenge himself upon his literary enemies. The plot is this: Eusden
the poet-laureate being dead, the goddess of Dulness elects Colley
Cibber as his successor. The installation is celebrated by games, the
most important being the &quot;reading of two voluminous works, one in verse
and the other in prose, without nodding.&quot; King Cibber is then taken to
the temple of Dulness, and lulled to sleep on the lap of the goddess. In
his dream he sees the triumphs of the empire. Finally the goddess having
established the kingdom on a firm basis, Night and Chaos are restored,
and the poem ends (1728-42).</p>

conceited, whimsical old gentleman, who forever interrupts a speaker

a sentence, but runs on in this style: &quot;Dover is an odd sort of a&mdash;eh?&quot;
&quot;It is a dingy kind of a&mdash;humph!&quot; &quot;The ladies will be happy to&mdash;eh?&quot; He
is the father of two daughters, Harriet and Kitty, whom he accidentally

sanctions the marriages, and discovers that the two lovers, both in
family and fortune, are suitable sons-in-law.</p>

<p><i>Lady Dunder</i>, fat, fair, and forty if not more. A country lady, more
fond of making jams and pastry than doing the fine lady. She prefers

&quot;his rage arose,&quot; and he went &quot;by night with his warriors&quot; and slew
Rathmor in his banquet hall. Touched with pity for his two young sons
(Calthon and Colmar), he took them to his own house and brought them up.
&quot;They bent the bow in his presence, and went forth to his wars.&quot; But
observing that their countenances fell, Dunthalmo began to be suspicious
of the young men, and shut them up in two separate caves on the banks of
the Tweed, where neither &quot;the sun penetrated by day nor the moon by
night.&quot; Colmal (the daughter of Dunthalmo), disguised as a young
warrior, loosed Calthon from his bonds, and fled with him to the court
of Fingal, to crave aid for the liberation of Colmar. Fingal sent his
son Ossian with 300 men to effect this object, but Dunthalmo, hearing of
their approach, gathered together his strength and slew Colmar. He also
seized Calthon, mourning for his brother, and bound him to an oak. At
daybreak Ossian moved to the fight, slew Dunthalmo, and having released
Calthon, &quot;gave him to the white-bosomed Colmal.&quot;&mdash;Ossian, <i>Calthon and

&quot;The cleanliness of Dutch housewifery was<br>
always extreme. Everything had to submit to<br>
scrubbing and scouring; dirt in no form could<br>
be endured by them, and dear as water was in<br>
the city, where it was generally sold, still it was<br>
in perpetual requisition. It was their honest<br>
pride to see a well-furnished dresser, showing<br>
copper and pewter in shining splendor as if for<br>
ornament rather than for use. In all this they<br>
differed widely from the Germans, a people with<br>
whom they have been erroneously and often<br>
confounded. Roost fowls and ducks are not<br>
more different. As water draws one it repels<br>
the other.&quot;<br>

Spain will one day be as proud of you as Greece was of the seven sages.&quot;
After this, Gil Blas could do no less than ask the man to sup with him.
Omelet after omelet was despatched, trout was called for, bottle
followed bottle, and when the parasite was gorged to satiety, he rose

first created Bishop of Exeter, and then of Worcester (1605-1662).</p>

<p>In the <i>Eikon Basilik&ecirc;</i> a strain of majestic

sister) and Morgause (the half-sister) of Arthur. Both are called the
mother of Mordred, and both are also called the wife of Lot. This,
however, is a mistake. Elain was the wife of Sir Nentres, and Morgause
of Lot; and if Gawain, Agrawain, Gareth and Gaheris were [half] brothers
of Mordred, as we are told over and over again, then Morgause and not
Elain was his mother. Tennyson makes Bellicent the wife of Lot, but this
is not in accordance with any of the legends collected by Sir T. Malory.</p>

called &quot;the lily maid of Astolat&quot; (<i>Guildford</i>), and knowing that
Launcelot was pledged to celibacy, she pined and died. According to her

to make a very eligible wife for himself. The king assented to the
match, and became godfather to the first child, who was called Edgar.
One day the king told his friend he intended to pay him a visit, and
Aethelwald revealed to his wife the story of his deceit, imploring her

up the throne. Whereupon the younger brother (Polynik&ecirc;s) interested six
Grecian chiefs to espouse his cause, and the allied armies laid siege to
Thebes, without success. Subsequently, the seven sons of the old chiefs
went against the city to avenge the death of their fathers, who had
fallen in the former siege. They succeeded in taking the city, and in
placing Thersander on the throne. The names of the seven sons are
Thersander, AEgi'aleus, Alkmaeon, Diomed&ecirc;s, Sthen'elos, Pro'machos,
and Euryalos.</p>

<p><b>Epimen'ides</b> (<i>5 syl.</i>) of Crete, sometimes reckoned one of the
&quot;seven wise men of Greece&quot; in the place of Periander. He slept for
fifty-seven years in a cave, and, on waking, found everything so changed
that he could recognize nothing. Epimenid&ecirc;s lived 289 years, and was
adored by the Cretans as one of their &quot;Curet&ecirc;s&quot; or priests of Jove.
He was contemporary with Solon.</p>

<p>(Goethe has a poem called <i>Des Epimenides Erwachen.</i>&mdash;See Heinrich's
<i>Epimenides.)</i></p>

<p>1. HENRY IV. was told that &quot;he should not die but in Jerusalem,&quot; which
he supposed meant the Holy Land; but he died in the Jerusalem Chamber,
London, which is the chapter-house of Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>2. POPE SYLVESTER was also told that he should die at Jerusalem, and he
died while saying mass in a church so called at Rome.</p>

<p>3. CAMBYSES, son of Cyrus, was told that he should die in Ecbat'ana,
which he supposed meant the capital of Media. Being wounded accidentally
in Syria, he asked the name of the place; and being told it was
Ecbatana, &quot;Here, then, I am destined to end my life.&quot;</p>

<p>4. A Messenian seer, being sent to consult the Delphic oracle respecting
the issue of the Messenian war, then raging, received for reply:</p>

When the goat stoops to drink of the Neda, O, seer,<br>
From Messenia flee, for its ruin is near!<br>

<p>In order to avert this calamity, all goats were diligently chased from
the banks of the Neda. One day, Theoclos observed a <i>fig tree</i> growing
on the river-side, and its branches dipped into the stream. The
interpretation of the oracle flashed across his mind, for he remembered
that <i>goat</i> and <i>fig tree</i>, in the Messenian dialect were the same word.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/therefore.jpg" width="35" height="23" alt="therefore.jpg">The pun would be clearer to an English reader if &quot;a stork&quot; were
substituted for <i>the goat</i>: &quot;When a stork stoops to drink of the Neda;&quot;
and the &quot;stalk&quot; of the fig tree dipping into the stream.</p>

<p>5. When the allied Greeks demanded of the Delphic oracle what would be
the issue of the battle of Salamis, they received for answer:</p>

Seed-time and harvest, weeping sires shall tell<br>
How thousands fought at Salamis and fell;<br>

<p>but whether the oracle referred to the Greeks or Persians who were to
fall by &quot;thousands,&quot; was not stated.</p>

<p>6. When CROESUS demanded what would be the issue of the battle against
the Persians, headed by Cyrus, the answer was, he &quot;should behold a
mighty empire overthrown;&quot; but whether that empire was his own, or that
of Cyrus, only the actual issue of the fight could determine.</p>

<p>7. Similarly, when PHILIP of Macedon sent to Delphi to inquire if his
Persian expedition would prove successful, he received for reply, &quot;The
ready victim crowned for sacrifice stands before the altar.&quot; Philip took
it for granted that the &quot;ready victim&quot; was the king of Persia, but it
was himself.</p>

<p>8. TARQUIN sent to Delphi to learn the fate of his struggle with the
Romans for the recovery of his throne, and was told, &quot;Tarquin will never
fall till a dog speaks with the voice of a man.&quot; The &quot;dog&quot; was Junius
Brutus, who was called a dog by way of contempt.</p>

<p>9. When the oracle was asked who would succeed Tarquin, it replied, &quot;He
who shall first kiss his mother.&quot; Whereupon Junius Brutus fell to the
earth, and exclaimed, &quot;Thus, then, I kiss thee, O mother earth!&quot;</p>

<p>10. Jourdain, the wizard, told the duke of Somerset, if he wished to
live, to &quot;avoid where castles mounted stand.&quot; The duke died in an
ale-house called the Castle, in St. Alban's.&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>2 Henry VI.</i>

<p>11. A wizard told King Edward IV. that &quot;after him should reign one the
first letter of whose name should be G.&quot; The king thought the person
meant was his brother George, but the duke of Gloucester was the person
pointed at.&mdash;Holinshed, <i>Chronicles</i>; Shakespeare, <i>Richard III.</i> act i.

<p><b>Erac'lius</b> (<i>The emperor</i>) condemned a knight to death on the
supposition of murder; but the man supposed to be murdered making his
appearance, the condemned man was taken back, under the expectation that
he would be instantly acquitted. But no, Eraclius ordered all three to
be put to death: the knight, because the emperor had ordered it; the man
who brought him back, because he had not carried out the emperor's
order; and the man supposed to be murdered, because he was virtually the
cause of death to the other two.</p>

<p>This tale is told in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, and Chaucer has put it into
the mouth of his Sumpnor. It is also told by Seneca, in his <i>De Ira</i>;
but he ascribes it to Cornelius Piso, and not to Eraclius.</p>

<p>It is said that Thomas of Erceldoun is not dead, but that he is sleeping
beneath the Eildon Hills, in Scotland. One day, he met with a lady of
elfin race beneath the Eildon tree, and she led him to an under-ground
region, where he remained for seven years. He then revisited the earth,
but bound himself to return when summoned. One day, when he was making
merry with his friends, he was told that a hart and hind were parading
the street; and he knew it was his summons, so he immediately went to
the Eildon tree, and has never since been heard of.&mdash;Sir W. Scott,

Kail'yal (<i>2 syl</i>.), daughter of Ladur'lad, and carried her to his Bower
of Bliss in paradise (canto vii.). Here Kailyal could not stay, because
she was still a living daughter of earth. On her return to earth, she
was chosen for the bride of Jagannaut, and Ar'valan came to dishonor
her; but she set fire to the pagoda, and Ereenia came to her rescue.
Ereenia was set upon by the witch Lor'rimite (<i>3 syl</i>.), and carried to
the submerged city of Baly, whence he was delivered by Ladurlad. The
glendoveer now craved Seeva for vengeance, but the god sent him to Yamen
(<i>i.e.</i> Pluto), and Yamen said the measure of iniquity was now full, so
Arvalan and his father Kehama were both made inmates of the city of
everlasting woe; while Ereenia carried Kailyal, who had quaffed the
waters of immortality, to his Bower of Bliss, to dwell with him in
everlasting joy.&mdash;Southey, <i>Curse of Kehoma</i> (1809).</p>

S&ecirc;pias, so that even supposing the whole of the rest were engaged, the
number could not exceed 800.&mdash;<i>Isles of Greece</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Isle Teos</i>. In the same poem he refers to &quot;Teos&quot; as one of the
isles of Greece, but Teos is a maritime town on the coast of Ionia, in
Asia Minor.</p>

<p>CERVANTES. <i>Dorothea's Father</i>. Dorothea represents herself as Queen of
Micomicon, because both her father and mother were <i>dead</i>, but Don
Quixote speaks of him to her as <i>alive</i>.&mdash;Pt. I. iv. 8.</p>

<p><i>Mambrino's Helmet</i>. In pt. I. iii. 8 we are told that the galley-slaves
set free by Don Quixote assaulted him with stones, and &quot;snatching the
basin from his head, <i>broke it to pieces</i>.&quot; In bk. iv. 15 we find this
basin quite whole and sound, the subject of a judicial inquiry, the
question being whether it was a helmet or a barber's basin. Sancho (ch.
11) says, he &quot;picked it up, bruised and battered, intending to get it
mended;&quot; but he says, &quot;I broke it to pieces,&quot; or, according to one
translator, &quot;broke it into a thousand pieces.&quot; In bk. iv. 8 we are told
that Don Quixote &quot;came from his chamber armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i>, with the
barber's basin on his head.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Sancho's Ass</i>. We are told (pt. I. iii. 9) that Gines de Passamonte
&quot;stole Sancho's ass.&quot; Sancho laments the loss with true pathos, and the
knight condoles with him. But soon afterwards Cervantes says: &quot;He
<i>[Sancho]</i> jogged on leisurely upon his ass after his master.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Sancho's Great-coat</i>. Sancho Panza, we are told, left his wallet behind
in the Crescent Moon tavern, where he was tossed in a blanket, and put
the provisions left by the priests in his great-coat (ch. 5). The
galley-slaves robbed him of &quot;his <i>great-coat</i>, leaving only his doublet&quot;
(ch. 8), but in the next chapter (9) we find &quot;the victuals had not been
touched,&quot; though the rascals &quot;searched diligently for booty.&quot; Now, if
the food was in the great-coat, and the great-coat was stolen, how is it
that the victuals remained in Sancho's possession untouched?</p>

<p><i>Sancho's Wallet</i>. We are told that Sancho left his wallet by mistake at
the tavern where he was blanket-tossed (ch. 5), but in ch. 9, when he
found the portmanteau, &quot;he crammed the gold and linen into his
wallet.&quot;&mdash;Pt. I. iii.</p>

<p>To make these oversights more striking, the author says, when Sancho
found the portmanteau, &quot;he entirely forgot the loss of his <i>wallet</i>, his
<i>great-coat</i>, and of his faithful companion and servant Dapple&quot; (<i>the
ass</i>).</p>

<p><i>Supper</i>. Cervantes makes the party at the Crescent tavern eat two
suppers in one evening. In ch. 5 the curate orders in supper, and &quot;after
supper&quot; they read the story of <i>Fatal Curiosity</i>. In ch. 12 we are told
&quot;the cloth was laid [<i>again</i>] for supper,&quot; and the company sat down to
it, quite forgetting that they had already supped.&mdash;Pt. I. iv.</p>

<p>CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA states that &quot;the fame of Beaumarchais rests on
his two operas, <i>Le Barbier de Seville</i> (1755) and <i>Le Mariage de
Figaro</i>.&quot; Every one knows that Mozart composed the opera of <i>Figaro</i>
(1786), and that Casti wrote the libretto. The opera of <i>Le Barbier de
Seville</i>, or rather <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>, was composed by Rossini,
in 1816. What Beaumarchais wrote was two comedies, one in four acts and
the other in five acts.&mdash;Art. &quot;Beaumarchais.&quot;</p>

<p>CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL. We are told, in a paper entitled &quot;Coincidences,&quot;
that Thursday has proved a fatal day with the Tudors, for on that day
died Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. If
this had been the case it would, indeed, have been startling; but what
are the facts? Henry VIII. died on <i>Friday</i>, January 28, 1547, and
Elizabeth died on <i>Monday</i>, March 24, 1603.&mdash;Rymer, <i>Foedera</i>, xv.</p>

<p>In the same paper we are told with equal inaccuracy that <i>Saturday</i> has
been fatal to the present dynasty, &quot;for William IV. and every one of the
Georges died on a Saturday.&quot; What, however, says history proper? William
IV. died on <i>Tuesday</i>, June 20, 1837; George I. died <i>Wednesday</i>.</p>

<p>June 11, 1727; George III. died <i>Monday</i>, January 29, 1820; George IV.
died <i>Sunday</i>, June 26, 1830; and only George II. died on a <i>Saturday</i>,
&quot;the day [<i>so</i>] fatal to the present dynasty.&quot;</p>

<p>CHAUCER says: The throstle-cock sings so sweet a tone that Tubal
himself, the first musican, could not equal it.&mdash;<i>The Court of Love</i>. Of
course he means Jubal.</p>

<p>CIBBER (<i>Colley</i>), in his <i>Love Makes a Man</i>, i., makes Carlos the
student say, &quot;For the cure of herds [<i>Virgil's</i>] <i>bucolicks</i> are a
master-piece; but when his art describes the commonwealth of bees ...
I'm ravished.&quot; He means <i>Georgics</i>. The <i>Bucolics</i> are eclogues, and
never touch upon either of these subjects. The diseases and cures of
cattle are in <i>Georgic</i> iii., and the habits, etc., of bees, <i>Georgic</i>
iv.</p>

<p>CID (<i>The</i>). When Alfonso succeeded his brother Sancho and banished the
Cid, Rodrigo is made to say:</p>

Prithee say where were these gallants<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Bold enough when far from blows)?</span><br>
Where were they when I, unaided,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rescued thee from thirteen foes?</span><br>

<p>The historic fact is, not that Rodrigo rescued Alfonso from thirteen
foes, but that the Cid rescued Sancho from thirteen of Alfonso's foes.
Eleven he slew, and two he put to flight.&mdash;<i>The Cid</i>, xvi. 78.</p>

<p>COLMAN. Job Thornberry says to Peregrine, who offers to assist him in
his difficulties, &quot;Desist, young man, in time.&quot; But Peregrine was at
least 45 years old when so addressed. He was 15 when Job first knew him,
and had been absent thirty years in Calcutta. Job Thornberry himself was
not above five or six years older.</p>

<p>COWPER calls the rose &quot;the glory of April and May,&quot; but June is the
great rose month. In the south of England they begin to bloom in the
latter half of May, and go on to the middle of July. April roses would
be horticultural curiosities.</p>

<p>CRITICS at fault. The licentiate tells Don Quixote that some critics
found fault with him for defective memory, and instanced it in this; &quot;We
are told that Sancho's ass is stolen, but the author has forgotten to
mention who the thief was.&quot; This is not the case, as we are distinctly
informed that it was stolen by Gines de Passamonte, one of the galley
slaves.&mdash;<i>Don Quixote</i>, II. i. 3.</p>

<p>DICKENS, in <i>Edwin Drood</i>, puts &quot;rooks and rooks' nests&quot; (instead of
daws) &quot;in the tower of Cloisterham.&quot;</p>

<p>In <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> he presents Mr. Squeers as setting his boys &quot;to
hoe turnips&quot; in midwinter.</p>

<p>In <i>The Tale of Two Cities</i>, iii. 4, he says: &quot;The name of the strong
man of Old Scripture descended to the chief functionary who worked the
guillotine.&quot; But the name of this functionary was Sanson, not Samson.</p>

<p>GALEN says that man has seven bones in the sternum (instead of three);
and Sylvius, in reply to Vesalius, contends that &quot;in days of yore the
robust chests of heroes had more bones than men now have.&quot;</p>

<p>GREENE (<i>Robert</i>) speaks of Delphos as an <i>island</i>; But Delphos, or
rather Delphi, was a city of Phocis, and no island. &quot;Six noblemen were
sent to the isle of Delphos.&quot;&mdash;<i>Donastus and Faunia</i>. Probably he
confounded the city of Delphi with the isle of Delos.</p>

<p>HALLIWELL, in his <i>Archaic Dictionary</i>, says: &quot;Crouchmas means
Christmas,&quot; and adds that Tusser is his authority. But this is
altogether a mistake. Tusser, in his &quot;<i>May</i> Remembrances,&quot; says: &quot;From
bull cow fast, till Crouchmas be past,&quot; <i>i.e.</i> St. Helen's Day. Tusser
evidently means from May 3 (the invention of the Cross) to August 18
(St. Helen's Day or the Cross-mas), not Christmas.</p>

<p>HIGGONS (<i>Bevil</i>) says:</p>

The Cyprian queen, drawn by Apell&ecirc;s hand.<br>
Of perfect beauty did the pattern stand!<br>
But then bright nymphs from every part of Greece<br>
Did all contribute to adorn the piece.<br>

<p><i>To Sir Godfrey Kneller</i> (1780).</p>

<p>Tradition says that Apell&ecirc;s model was either Phyrne, or Campasp&ecirc;,
afterwards his wife. Campbell has borrowed these lines, but ascribes the
painting to Protog'en&ecirc;s the Rhodian.</p>

When first the Rhodian's mimic art arrayed<br>
The queen of Beauty in her Cyprian shade,<br>
The happy master mingled in the piece<br>
Each look that charmed him in the fair of Greece.<br>

<p><i>Pleasures of Hope</i>, ii.</p>

<p>JOHNSON (<i>Dr</i>.) makes Addison speak of Steele as &quot;Little Dicky&quot; whereas
the person so called by Addison was not Richard Steele, but a dwarfish
actor who played &quot;Gomez&quot; in Dryden's <i>Spanish Fryar</i>.</p>

<p>LONDON NEWSPAPER (<i>A</i>), one of the leading journals of the day, has
spoken three times within two years of &quot;passing <i>under</i> the Caudine
Forks,&quot; evidently supposing them to be a &quot;yoke&quot; instead of a valley or
mountain pass.</p>

<p>LONGFELLOW calls Erig'ena a <i>Scotchman</i>, whereas the very word means an
Irishman.</p>

Done into Latin by that Scottish beast.<br>
Erigena Johannes.<br>

<p><i>Golden Legend</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Without doubt, the poet mistook John Duns <i>[Scottus]</i>, who died in
1308, for John Scottus <i>[Erigena]</i>, who died in 875. Erigena translated
into Latin, <i>St. Dionysius.</i> He was latitudinarian in his views, and
anything but 'a Scottish beast or Calvinist.'&quot;</p>

<p><i>The Two Angels</i>. Longfellow crowns the <i>death-angel</i> with amaranth,
with which Milton says, &quot;the spirits elect bind their resplendent
locks;&quot; and his angel of <i>life</i> he crowns with asphodels, the flowers of
Pluto or the grave.</p>

<p>MELVILLE (<i>Whyte</i>) makes a very prominent part of his story called
<i>Holmby House</i> turn on the death of a favorite hawk named Diamond, which
Mary Cave tossed off, and saw &quot;fall lifeless at the king's feet&quot; (ch.
xxix.). In ch. xlvi. this very hawk is represented to be alive; &quot;proud,
beautiful, and cruel, like a <i>Venus Victrix</i> it perched on her
mistress's wrist, unhooded.&quot;</p>

<p>MILTON. &quot;Colkitto or Macdonnel or Galasp.&quot; In this line of Sonnet XI,
Milton seems to speak of three different persons, but in reality they
are one and the same; i.e., Macdonnel, son of Colkittoch, son of
Gillespie (Galasp). Colkittoch means left-handed.</p>

<p>In <i>Comus</i> (ver. 880) he makes the siren Ligea sleek her hair with a
golden comb, as if she were a Scandinavian mermaid.</p>

<p>MOORE (<i>Thom</i>.) says:</p>

The sunflower turns on her god, when he sets,<br>
The same look which she turned when he rose.<br>

<p><i>Irish Melodies</i>, ii. (&quot;Believe Me, if all those
Endearing Young Charms&quot;).</p>

<p>The sunflower does not turn either to the rising or setting sun. It
receives its name solely because it resembles a picture sun. It is not a
turn-sun or heliotrope at all.</p>

<p>MORRIS (<i>W</i>.), in his <i>Atalanta's Race</i>, renders the Greek word
<i>Saophron</i> &quot;safron,&quot; and says:</p>

She the saffron gown will never wear,<br>
And in no flower-strewn couch shall she be laid;<br>

<p><i>i.e.</i> she will never be a bride. Nonnius (bk. xii.) tells us that
virtuous women wore a girdled gown called <i>Saophron</i> (&quot;chaste&quot;), to
indicate their purity and to prevent indecorous liberties. The gown was
not yellow at all, but it was girded with a girdle.</p>

<p>MURPHY, in the <i>Grecian Daughter</i>, says (act i. 1):</p>

Have you forgot the elder Dionysius,<br>
Surnamed the Tyrant?... Evander came from Greece,<br>
And sent the tyrant to his humble rank,<br>
Once more reduced to roam for vile subsistence,<br>
A wandering sophist thro' the realms of Greece.<br>

<p>It was not Dionysius the <i>Elder</i>, but Dionysius the <i>Younger</i>, who was
the &quot;wandering sophist;&quot; and it was not Evander, but Timoleon, who
dethroned him. The elder Dionysius was not dethroned at all, nor even
reduced &quot;to humble rank.&quot; He reigned thirty-eight years without
interruption, and died a king, in the plentitude of his glory, at the
age of 63.</p>

<p>In the same play (act iv. 1) Euphrasia says to Dionysius the Younger:</p>

Think of thy father's fate at Corinth, Dionysius.<br>

<p>It was not the father, but the son, (Dionysius the Younger) who lived in
exile at Corinth.</p>

<p>In the same play he makes Timo'leon victorious over the Syracusans (that
is historically correct); and he makes Euphrasia stab Dionysius the
Younger, whereas he retreated to Corinth, and spent his time in
debauchery, but supported himself by keeping a school. Of his death
nothing is known, but certainly he was not stabbed to death by
Euphrasia.&mdash;See Plutarch.</p>

<p>RYMER, in his <i>Foedera</i>, ascribes to Henry I. (who died in 1135) a
preaching expedition for the restoration of Rochester Church, injured by
fire in 1177 (vol. I i. 9).</p>

<p>In the previous page Rymer ascribes to Henry I. a deed of gift from
&quot;Henry, king of England and <i>lord of Ireland</i>;&quot; but every one knows that
Ireland was conquered by Henry II., and the deed referred to was the act
of Henry III.</p>

<p>On p. 71 of the same vol. Odo is made, in 1298, to swear &quot;in no wise to
confederate with Richard I.&quot;; whereas Richard I. died in 1199.</p>

<p>SABINE MAID (<i>The</i>). G. Gilfillan, in his introductory essay to
Longfellow, says: &quot;His ornaments, unlike those of the Sabine maid, have
not crushed him.&quot; Tarpeia, who opened the gates of Rome to the Sabines,
and was crushed to death by their shields, was not a <i>Sabine</i> maid, but
a Roman.</p>

<p>SCOTT (<i>Sir Walter</i>). In the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i> we read;:</p>

<p>She <i>[Effie Deans</i>] amused herself with visiting the dairy ... and was
so near discovering herself to Mary Hetly by betraying her aquaintance
with the celebrated receipt for Dunlop cheese, that she compared herself
to Bedredeen Hassan, whom the vizier his father in-law discovered by his
superlative skill in composing cream-tarts with pepper in them.</p>

<p>In these few lines are several gross errors: (1) cream-tarts should be
<i>cheese-cakes</i>; (2) the charge was &quot;that he made cheese-cakes <i>without</i>
putting pepper in them,&quot; and not that he made &quot;cream-tarts <i>with</i>
pepper;&quot; (3) it was not the vizier, his father-in-law and uncle, but his
mother, the widow of Nouredeen, who made the discovery, and why? for the
best of all reasons&mdash;because she herself had taught her son the receipt.
The party were at Damascus at the time.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights</i> (&quot;Nouredeen
Ali,&quot; etc.). (See page 389, &quot;Thackeray.&quot;)</p>

&quot;What!&quot; said Bedredeen, &quot;was everything in<br>
my house to be broken and destroyed ... only<br>
because I did not put pepper in a cheese-cake!&quot;<br>

<p><i>Arabian Nights</i> (&quot;Nouredeen Ali,&quot; etc.).</p>

<p>Again, Sir Walter Scott speaks of &quot;the philosopher who appealed from
Philip inflamed with wine to Philip in his hours of sobriety&quot;
(<i>Antiquary</i>, x.). This &quot;philosopher&quot; was a poor old woman.</p>

<p>SHAKESPEARE. <i>Althaea and the Fire-brand</i>. Shakespeare says, (<i>Henry
IV</i>. act ii. sc. 2) that &quot;Althaea dreamt that she was delivered of a
fire-brand.&quot; It was not Althaea, but Hecuba, who dreamed, a little
before Paris was born, that her offspring was a brand that consumed the
kingdom. The tale of Althaea is, that the Fates laid a log of wood on a
fire, and told her that her son would live till that log was consumed;
whereupon she snatched up the log and kept it from the fire, till one
day her son Melea'ger offended her, when she flung the log on the fire,
and her son died, as the Fates predicted.</p>

<p><i>Bohemia's Coast</i>. In the <i>Winter's Tale</i> the vessel bearing the infant
Perdita is &quot;driven by storm on the coast of Bohemia;&quot; but Bohemia has no
seaboard at all.</p>

<p>In <i>Coriolanus</i>, Shakespeare makes Volumnia the mother, and Virgilia the
wife, of Coriolanus; but his <i>wife</i> was Volumnia, and his <i>mother</i>
Veturia.</p>

<p><i>Delphi an Island</i>. In the same drama (act iii. sc. 1) Delphi is spoken
of as an island; but Delphi is a city of Phocis, containing a temple to
Apollo. It is no island at all.</p>

<p><i>Duncan's Murder</i>. Macbeth did not murder Duncan in the castle of
Inverness, as stated in the play, but at &quot;the smith's house,&quot; near Elgin
(1039).</p>

<p><i>Elsinore</i>. Shakespeare speaks of the beetling cliff of Elsinore,
whereas Elsinore has no cliffs at all.</p>

What if it [<i>the ghost</i>] tempt you toward the flood.<br>
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br>
That beetles o'er its base into the sea?<br>

<p><i>Hamlet</i>, act i. sc. 4.</p>

<p><i>The Ghost</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, is evidently a Roman Catholic; he talks of
purgatory, absolution, and other Catholic dogmas; but the Danes at
the time were pagans.</p>

<p><i>St. Louis</i>. Shakespeare, in <i>Henry V</i>. act i. sc. 2, calls Louis X.
&quot;St. Louis,&quot; but &quot;St. Louis&quot; was Louis IX. It was Louis IX. whose
&quot;grandmother was Isabel,&quot; issue of Charles de Lorraine, the last of the
Carlovingians. Louis X. was the son of Philippe IV. (<i>le Bel</i>) and
grandson of Philippe III. and &quot;Isabel of Aragon,&quot; not Isabel, &quot;heir of
Capet of the line of Charles the duke of Lorain.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Macbeth</i> was no tyrant, as Shakespeare makes him out to be, but a firm
and equitable prince, whose title to the throne was better than that of
Duncan.</p>

<p>Again, <i>Macbeth</i> was not slain by Macduff at Dunsin'ane, but made his
escape from the battle, and was slain in 1056, at Lumphanan.&mdash;Lardner,
<i>Cabinet Cyc</i>., 17-19.</p>

<p>In <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, act v. sc. 2, one of the gentlemen refers to
Julio Romano, the Italian artist and architect (1492-1546), certainly
some 1800 years or more before Romano was born.</p>

<p>In <i>Twelfth Night</i>, the Illyrian clown speaks of St. Bennet's Church,
London. &quot;The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of
St. Bennet's sure may put you in mind: one, two, three&quot; (act v. sc. 1);
as if the duke was a Londoner.</p>

<p>SPENSER. <i>Bacchus</i> or <i>Saturn</i>? In the <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iii. 11, Britomart
saw in the castle of Bu'sirane (<i>3 syl</i>.), a picture descriptive of the
love of Saturn, who had changed himself into a centaur out of love for
Erig'on&ecirc;. It was not Saturn, but Bacchus who loved Erig'on&ecirc;, and he was
not tranformed into a centaur, but to a horse.</p>

<p><i>Beon&ecirc;</i> or <i>Oenon&ecirc;</i>? In bk. vi. 9 (<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>) the lady-love of Paris
is called Benon&ecirc;, which ought to be Oenon&ecirc;. The poet says that Paris
was &quot;by Plexippus' brook&quot; when the golden apple was brought to him; but
no such brook is mentioned by any classic author.</p>

<p><i>Critias and Socrates</i>. In bk. ii. 7 <i>(Fa&euml;ry Queen)</i> Spenser says: &quot;The
wise Socrates ... poured out his life ... to the dear Critias; his
dearest bel-amie.&quot; It was not Socrat&ecirc;s, but Theram'enes, one of the
thirty tyrants, who in quaffing the poison-cup, said smiling, &quot;This I
drink to the health of fair Critias.&quot;&mdash;Cicero, <i>Tusculan Questions</i>.</p>

<p><i>Critias</i> or <i>Crito</i>? In <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iv. (introduction), Spenser says
that Socrates often discoursed of love to his friend Critias; but it was
Crito, or rather Criton that the poet means.</p>

<p><i>Cyprus</i> and <i>Paphos</i>. Spenser makes Sir Scudamore speak of a temple of
Venus, far more beautiful than &quot;that in Paphos, or that in Cyprus;&quot; but
Paphos was merely a town in the island of Cyprus, and the &quot;two&quot; are but
one and the same temple.&mdash;<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, iv. 10.</p>

<p><i>Hippoman&ecirc;s</i>. Spenser says the golden apples of Mammon's garden were
better than Those with which the Eubaean young man won Swift Atalanta.
<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, ii. 7.</p>

<p>The young man was Hippom'an&ecirc;s. He was not a &quot;Eubaean,&quot; but a native of
Onchestos, in Boeo'tia.</p>

<p>TENNYSON, in the <i>Last Tournament</i>, says (ver. I), Dagonet was knighted
in mockery by Sir Gaw'ain; but in the <i>History of Prince Arthur</i> we are
distinctly told that King Arthur knighted him with his own hand (pt. ii.
91).</p>

<p>In <i>Gareth and Lynette</i> the same poet says that Grareth was the son of
Lot and Bellicent; but we are told a score times and more in the
<i>History of Prince Arthur</i>, that he was the son of Margawse (Arthur's
sister and Lot's wife, pt. i. 36).</p>

<p>King Lot ... wedded Margawse; Nentres ... wedded Elain.&mdash;Sir T. Malory,
<i>History of Prince Arthur</i>, i. 2, 35, 36.</p>

<p>In the same <i>Idyll</i> Tennyson has changed Lion&ecirc;s to Lyonors; but,
according to the collection of romances edited by Sir T. Malory, these
were quite different persons. Lion&ecirc;s, daughter of Sir Persaunt, and
sister of Linet of Castle Perilous, married Sir Gareth (pt. i. 153); but
Lyonors was the daughter of Earl Sanam, and was the unwedded mother of
Sir Borre by King Arthur (pt. i. 15).</p>

<p>Again, Tennyson makes Gareth marry Lynette, and leaves the true heroine,
Lyonors, in the cold; but the <i>History</i> makes Grareth marry Lion&ecirc;s
<i>(Lyonors)</i>, and Gaheris his brother marries Linet.</p>

<p>Thus endeth the history of Sir Gareth, that wedded Dame Liones of the
Castle Perilous; and also of Sir Gaheris, who wedded her sister Dame
Linet.&mdash;Sir T. Malory, <i>History of Prince Arthur</i> (end of pt. i.).</p>

<p>Again, in <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>, by erroneously beginning day with
sunrise instead of the previous eve, Tennyson reverses the order of the
knights, and makes the <i>fresh green morn</i> represent the decline of day,
or, as he calls it, &quot;Hesperus&quot; or &quot;Evening Star;&quot; and the blue star of
evening he makes &quot;Phosphorus&quot; or the &quot;Morning Star.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more, in <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>, the poet-laureate makes the combat
between Gareth and Death finished at a single blow, but in the
<i>History</i>, Gareth fights from dawn to dewy eve.</p>

<p>Thus they fought [<i>from sunrise</i>] till it was past noon, and would not
stint, till, at last both lacked wind, and then stood they wagging,
staggering, panting, blowing, and bleeding ... and when they had rested
them awhile, they went to battle again, trasing, rasing, and foyning, as
two boars ... Thus they endured till evening-song time.&mdash;Sir T. Malory,
<i>History of Prince Arthur</i>, i. 136.</p>

<p>In <i>the Last Tournament</i>, Tennyson makes Sir Tristram stabbed to death,
by Sir Mark in Tintag'il Castle, Cornwall, while toying with his aunt,
Isolt <i>the Fair</i>, but in the <i>History</i> he was in bed in Brittany,
severely wounded, and dies of a shock, because his wife tells him the
ship in which he expected his aunt to come was sailing into port with a
<i>black</i> sail instead of a white one.</p>

<p>The poet-laureate has deviated so often from the collection of tales
edited by Sir Thomas Malory, that it would occupy too much space to
point out his deviations even in the briefest manner.</p>

<p>THACKERAY, in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, has taken from Sir Walter Scott his
allusion to Bedredeen, and not from the <i>Arabian Nights.</i> He has,
therefore, fallen into the same error, and added two more. He says: &quot;I
ought to have remembered the pepper which the Princess of Persia puts
into the cream-tarts in India, sir&quot; (ch. iii.). The charge was that
Bedredeen made his <i>cheese-cakes without</i> putting pepper into them. But
Thackeray has committed in this allusion other blunders. It was not a
&quot;princess&quot; at all, but Bedredeen Hassan, who for the nonce had become a
confectioner. He learned the art of making cheese-cakes from his mother
(a widow). Again, it was not a &quot;princess of Persia,&quot; for Bedredeen's

<p>VICTOR HUGO, in <i>Les Travailleurs de la Mer</i>, renders &quot;the Frith of

<p>VIEGIL has placed &AElig;neas in a harbor which did not exist at the time.
&quot;Portusque require Velinos&quot; <i>(&AElig;neid</i>, vi. 366). It was Curius Dentatus
who cut a gorge through the rocks to let the waters of the Velinus into
the Nar. Before this was done, the Velinus was merely a number of
stagnant lakes, and the blunder is about the same as if a modern poet
were to make Columbus pass through the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>In <i>&AElig;neid</i>, in. 171 Virgil makes &AElig;neas speak of &quot;Ausonia;&quot; but as Italy
was so called from Auson, son of Ulysses and Calypso, of course &AElig;neas
could not have known the name.</p>

<p>Again, in <i>&AElig;neid</i> ix. 571, he represents Chorinseus as slain by Asy'las;
but in bk. xii. 298 he is alive again. Thus:</p>

<p>Chorinaeum sternit Asylas</p>

<p>Bk. ix. 571.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

Obvius ambustum torrem Chorinseus ab ara<br>
Corripit, et venienti Ebuso plagamque ferenti<br>
Occupat os flammis, etc.<br>
<br>
Bk. xii. 298, etc.<br>

<p>Again in bk. ix. Numa is slain by Nisus, (ver. 554); but in bk. x. 562
Numa is alive, and &AElig;neas kills him.</p>

<p>Once more, in bk. x. &AElig;neas slays Camert&ecirc;s (ver. 562); but in bk. xii.
224 Jaturna, the sister of Turnus, assumes his shape. But if he was
dead, no one would have been deluded into supposing the figure to be the
living man.</p>

<p><b>Er'rua</b> (&quot;<i>the mad-cap</i>&quot;), a young man whose wit defeated the
strength of the giant Tartaro (a sort of one-eyed Polypheme). Thus the
first competition was in throwing a stone. The giant threw his stone,
but Errua threw a <i>bird</i>, which the giant supposed to be a stone, and as
it flew out of sight, Errua won the wager. The next wager was a bar of
iron. After the giant had thrown, Errua said, &quot;From here to Salamanca;&quot;
whereupon the giant bade him not to throw, lest the bar of iron should
kill his father and mother, who lived there; so the giant lost the
second wager. The third was to pull a tree up by the roots; and the
giant gave in because Errua had run a cord around a host of trees, and
said, &quot;You pull up one, but I pull up all these.&quot; The next exploit was
at bed-time; Errua was to sleep in a certain bed; but he placed a dead
man in the bed, while he himself got under it. At midnight Tartaro took
his club and belabored the dead body most unmercifully. When Errua stood
before Tartaro next morning, the giant was dumbfounded. He asked Errua
how he had slept. &quot;Excellently well,&quot; said Errua, &quot;but somewhat troubled
by fleas.&quot; Other trials were made, but always in favor of Errua. At
length a race was proposed, and Errua sewed into a bag the bowels of a
pig. When he started, he cut the bag, strewing the bowels on the road.
When Tartaro was told that his rival had done this to make himself more
fleet, he cut his belly, and of course killed himself.&mdash;Rev. W. Webster,

<p><b>Essex</b> (<i>The earl of</i>), a tragedy by Henry Jones (1745.) Lord
Burleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh entertained a mortal hatred of the earl
of Essex, and accused him to the queen of treason. Elizabeth disbelieved
the charge; but at this juncture the earl left Ireland, whither the
queen had sent him, and presented himself before her. She was very
angry, and struck him, and Essex rushed into open rebellion, was taken,
and condemned to death. The queen had given him a ring before the trial,
telling him whatever petition he asked should be granted, if he sent to
her this ring. When the time of execution drew nigh, the queen sent the
countess of Nottingham to the Tower, to ask Essex if he had any plea to
make. The earl entreated her to present the ring to her majesty, and
petition her to spare the life of his friend Southampton. The countess
purposely neglected this charge, and Essex was executed. The queen, it
is true, sent a reprieve, but Lord Burleigh took care it should arrive
too late. The poet says that Essex had recently married the countess of
Rutland, that both the queen and the countess of Nottingham were
jealous, and that this jealousy was the chief cause of the earl's death.</p>

rejoices in cheating those who employ him; he parodies proverbs,
rejoices in mischief, and is brimful of pranks and drolleries. Whether
Uulenspiegel was a real character or not is a matter of dispute, but by

Syracuse to save their infant son. Euphrasia, having gained admission to
the dungeon where her aged father was dying from starvation, &quot;fostered
him at her breast by the milk designed for her own babe, and thus the

affected by the gallants of England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
Thomas Lodge wrote a novel in a similar style, called <i>Euphues' Golden

<p><b>Eure'ka</b>! or rather HEUKE'KA! (&quot;I have discovered it!&quot;) The
exclamation of Archime'des, the Syracusan philosopher, when he found out
how to test the purity of Hi'ero's crown.</p>

<p>The tale is, that Hiero suspected that a craftsman to whom he had given
a certain weight of gold to make into a crown had alloyed the metal, and
he asked Archimed&ecirc;s to ascertain if his suspicion was well founded. The
philosopher, getting into his bath, observed that the water ran over,
and it flashed into his mind that his body displaced its own bulk of
water. Now, suppose Hiero gave the goldsmith 1 lb. of gold, and the
crown weighed 1 lb., it is manifest that if the crown was pure gold,
both ought to displace the same quantity of water; but they did not do
so, and therefore the gold had been tampered with. Archimedes next
immersed in water 1 lb. of silver, and the difference of water displaced
soon gave the clue to the amount of alloy introduced by the artificer.</p>

Vitruvius says: &quot;When the idea occurred to<br>
the philosopher, he jumped out of his bath, and<br>
without waiting to put on his clothes, he ran<br>
home, exclaiming, '<i>Heureka! heureka!</i>'&quot;<br>

<p><i>Evad'ne</i> or The Statue, a drama by Sheil (1820). Ludov'ico, the chief
minister of Naples, heads a conspiracy to murder the king and seize the
crown; his great stumbling-block is the marquis of Colonna, a
high-minded nobleman, who cannot be corrupted. The sister of the marquis
is Evadn&ecirc; (3 <i>syl</i>.), plighted to Vicentio. Ludovico's scheme is to get
Colonna to murder Vicentio and the king, and then to debauch Evadn&ecirc;.
With this in view, he persuades Vicentio that Evadn&ecirc; is the king's
<i>fille d'amour</i>, and that she marries him merely as a flimsy cloak, but
he adds &quot;Never mind, it will make your fortune.&quot; The proud Neapolitan is
disgusted, and flings off Evadn&ecirc; as a viper. Her brother is indignant,
challenges the troth-plight lover to a duel, and Vicentio falls.
Ludovico now irritates Colonna by talking of the king's amour, and
induces him to invite the king to a banquet and then murder him. The
king goes to the banquet, and Evadn&ecirc; shows him the statues of the
Colonna family, and amongst them one of her own father, who at the
battle of Milan had saved the king's life by his own. The king is struck
with remorse, but at this moment Ludovico enters and the king conceals
himself behind the statue. Colonna tells the traitor minister the deed
is done, and Ludovico orders his instant arrest, gibes him as his dupe,
and exclaims, &quot;Now I am king indeed!&quot; At this moment the king comes
forward, releases Colonna, and orders Ludovico to be arrested. The
traitor draws his sword, and Colonna kills him. Vicentio now enters,
tells how his ear has been abused, and marries Evadn&ecirc;.</p>

age of 17 she was legally betrothed by the notary-public to Gabriel, son
of Basil the blacksmith, but next day all the colony was exiled by the
order of George II., and their houses, cattle, and lands were
confiscated. Gabriel and Evangeline were parted, and now began the
troubles of her life. She wandered from place to place to find her
betrothed. Basil had settled at Louisiana, but when Evangeline reached
the place, Gabriel had just left; she then went to the prairies, to
Michigan, and so on, but at every place she was just too late to meet
him. At length, grown old in this hopeless search, she went to
Philadelphia and became a sister of mercy. The plague broke out in the
city, and as she visited the almshouse she saw an old man smitten down
with the pestilence. It was Gabriel. He tried to whisper her name, but
death closed his lips. He was buried, and Evangeline lies beside him in
the grave.</p>

domestic joys. By the fault of deficient spirit and manliness, Mr.
Placid was a hen-pecked husband. By the fault of marrying without the
consent of his wife's friends, Mr. Irwin was reduced to poverty and even

200 knights tried to release it, but failed; Arthur alone could draw it
with ease, and thus proved his right of succession (pt. i. 3). In ch. 7
this sword is called Excalibur, and is said to have been so bright &quot;that
it gave light like thirty torches.&quot; After his fight with Pellinore, the
king said to Merlin he had no sword, and Merlin took him to a lake, and
Arthur saw an arm &quot;clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in
the hand.&quot; Presently the Lady of the Lake appeared, and Arthur begged
that he might have the sword, and the lady told him to go and fetch it.
When he came to it he took it, &quot;and the arm and hand went under the
water again.&quot; This is the sword generally called Excalibur. When about
to die, King Arthur sent an attendant to cast the sword back again into
the lake, and again the hand &quot;clothed in white samite&quot; appeared, caught
it, and disappeared (ch. 23).&mdash;Sir T. Malory, <i>History of Prince

bribes, or to terrify him, but in vain. &quot;Excellent Fabricius,&quot; cried the
Greek, &quot;one might hope to turn the sun from its course as soon as turn
Fabricius from the path of duty.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Fabric'ius</i>, an author, whose composition was so obscure that Gil Blas
could not comprehend the meaning of a single line of his writings. His
poetry was verbose fustian, and his prose a maze of far-fetched
expressions and perplexed phrases.</p>

<p><b>Fabrit'io,</b> a merry soldier, the friend of Captain Jac'omo the
woman-hater.&mdash;Beaumont and Fletcher, <i>The Captain</i> (1613).</p>

<p><b>Face</b> (1 <i>syl.</i>), <i>alias</i> &quot;Jeremy,&quot; house-servant of Lovewit. During
the absence of his master, Face leagues with Subtle (the alchemist) and
Dol Common to turn a penny by alchemy, fortune-telling, and magic.
Subtle (a beggar who knew something about alchemy) was discovered by
Face near Pye Corner. Assuming the philosopher's garb and wand, he
called himself &quot;doctor;&quot; Face, arrogating the title of &quot;captain,&quot; touted
for dupes; while Dol Common kept the house, and aided the other two in
their general scheme of deception. On the unexpected return of Lovewit,
the whole thing blew up, but Face was forgiven, and continued in his
place as house-servant.&mdash;Ben Jonson, <i>The Alchemist</i> (1619).</p>

<p><b>Facto'tum</b> (<i>Johannes</i>), one employed to do all sorts of work for
another; one in whom another confides for all the odds and ends of his
household management or business.</p>

<p>He is an absolute Johannes Factotum, at least in his own
conceit.&mdash;Greene, <i>Groat's-worth of Wit</i> (1692).</p>

<p><b>Faddle</b> <i>(William)</i>, a &quot;fellow made up of knavery and noise, with
scandal for wit and impudence for raillery. He was so needy that the
very devil might have bought him for a guinea.&quot; Sir Charles Raymond says
to him:</p>

<p>&quot;Thy life is a disgrace to humanity. A foolish prodigality makes thee
needy; need makes thee vicious; and both make thee contemptible. Thy wit
is prostituted to slander and buffoonery; and thy judgment, if thou hast
any, to meanness and villainy. Thy betters, that laugh with thee, laugh
at thee; and all the varieties of thy life are but pitiful rewards and
painful abuses.&quot;&mdash;Ed. Moore, <i>The Foundling</i>, iv. 2 (1748).</p>

<p><b>Fa'dha</b> <i>(Ah)</i>, Mahomet's silver cuirass.</p>

<p><b>Fad'ladeen,</b> the great nazir' or chamberlain of Aurungze'b&ecirc;'s harem.
He criticises the tales told to Lalla Rookh by a young poet on her way
to Delhi, and great was his mortification to find that the poet was the
young king his master.</p>

<p>Fadladeen was a judge of everything, from the pencilling of a
Circassian's eyelids to the deepest questions of science and literature;
from the mixture of a conserve of rose leaves to the composition of an
epic poem.&mdash;T. Moore, <i>Lalla Rookh</i> (1817).</p>

<p><b>Fadladin'ida,</b> wife of King Chrononhotonthologos. While the king is
alive she falls in love with the captive king of the Antip'od&ecirc;s, and at
the death of the king, when two suitors arise, she says, &quot;Well,
gentlemen, to make matters easy, I'll take you both.&quot;&mdash;H. Cary,
<i>Chrononhotonthologos</i> (a burlesque).</p>

<p><b>Fa&euml;ry Queen</b>, a metrical romance, in six books, of twelve cantos

fragments of this book exist.</p>

<p><b>Fafnis</b>, the dragon with which Sigurd fights.&mdash;<i>Sigurd the Horny</i> (a
German romance based on a Norse legend).</p>

wit, as he does his lace, at second hand.&quot;&mdash;Sheridan, <i>The Rivals</i>
(1775).</p>

<p><b>Faggot</b> <i>(Nicholas)</i>, clerk to Matthew Foxley, the magistrate who
examined Darsie Latimer <i>(i. e</i>. Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet) after he
had been attacked by rioters.&mdash;Sir W. Scott, <i>Redgauntlet</i> (time, George
III.).</p>

<p><b>Faggots and Faggots</b> <i>(II y a fagots et fagots)</i>, all things of the
same sort are not equal in quality. In Moli&egrave;re's <i>Le M&eacute;decin Malgr&eacute;
Lui</i>, Sganarelle wants to show that his faggots are better than those of
other persons, and cries out &quot;Ay! but those faggots are not equal to
mine.&quot;</p>

<p>II est vrai, messieurs, que je suis le premier homme du monde pour faire
des fagots ...</p>

<p>Je n'y &eacute;pargne aucune chose, et les fais d'une facon qu'il n'y a rien a
dire ... Il y a fagots, et fagots.&mdash;Act i. 6 (1666).</p>

<p><b>Fagin</b>, an old Jew, who employs a gang of thieves, chiefly boys.
These boys he teaches to pick pockets and pilfer adroitly. Fagin assumes
a most suave and fawning manner, but is malicious, grasping, and full of
cruelty.&mdash;C. Dickens, <i>Oliver Twist</i> (1837).</p>

<p><b>Fainall</b>, cousin by marriage to Sir Wilful Witwould. He married a
young, wealthy, and handsome widow, but the two were cat and dog to each
other. The great aim of Fainall was to get into his possession the
estates of his wife (settled on herself &quot;in trust to Edward Mirabell&quot;),
but in this he failed. In outward semblance, Fainall was plausible
enough, but he was a goodly apple rotten at the core, false to his
friends, faithless to his wife, overreaching, and deceitful.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fainall</i>. Her first husband was Languish, son of Lady Wishford.
Her second husband she both despised and detested.&mdash;W. Congreve, <i>The
Way of the World</i> (1700).</p>

<p><b>Fainaso'lis</b>, daughter of Craca's king (<i>the Shetland Isles</i>). When
Fingal was quite a young man, she fled to him for protection against
Sora, but scarcely had he promised to take up her cause, when Sora
landed, drew the bow, and she fell. Fingal said to Sora, &quot;Unerring is
thy hand, O Sora, but feeble was the foe.&quot; He then attacked the invader,
and Sora fell.&mdash;Ossian, <i>Fingal</i>, iii.</p>

<p><b>Faint Heart Never Won Fair Lady</b>, a line in a ballad written to the
&quot;Berkshire Lady,&quot; a Miss Frances Kendrick, daughter of Sir William
Kendrick, second baronet. Sir William's father was created baronet by
Charles II. The wooer was a Mr. Child, son of a brewer at Abingdon, to
whom the lady sent a challenge.</p>

Having read this strange relation,<br>
He was in a consternation;<br>
But, advising with a friend,<br>
He persuades him to attend:<br>
&quot;Be of courage and make ready,<br>
Faint heart never won fair lady.&quot;<br>

by Mde. Vestris at the Olympic. Mde. Vestris herself performed the part

<p><b>Fair Penitent</b> (<i>The</i>) a tragedy by Rowe (1703). Calista was
daughter of Lord Sciol'to (3 <i>syl</i>.), and bride of Lord Al'tamont. It
was discovered on the wedding-day that she had been seduced by
Lotha'rio. This led to a duel between the bridegroom and the libertine,
in which Lothario was killed; a street riot ensued, in which Sciolto
receives his death-wound; and Calista, &quot;the fair penitent,&quot; stabbed
herself. The drama is a mere <i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of Massinger's <i>Fatal Dowry</i>.</p>

conscious that early petting at home and a foreign education have
developed physical cowardice. On his way home from England he falls into
the hands of desperadoes who force him to fire a pistol at a bound man.
The lad is almost fainting, and swoons with pain and horror when the
deed is, as he thinks, done. His father believes him a coward, and the
sense of this and a loving woman's trust in him, nerve him to deeds of
endurance and valor that clear his record triumphantly.&mdash;Octave Thanet,
<i>Expiation</i> (1890).</p>

<p><b>Fairstar</b> <i>(Princess)</i>, daughter of Queen Blon'dina (who had at one
birth two boys and a girl, all &quot;with stars on their foreheads, and a
chain of gold about their necks&quot;). On the same day, Blondina's sister
Brunetta (wife of the king's brother) had a son, afterwards called
Cherry. The queen-mother, wishing to destroy these four children,
ordered Fein'tisa to strangle them, but Feintisa sent them adrift in a
boat, and told the queen-mother they were gone. It so happened that the
boat was seen by a corsair, who brought the children to his wife
Cor'sina to bring up. The corsair soon grew immensely rich, because
every time the hair of these children was combed, jewels fell from their
heads. When grown up, these castaways went to the land of their royal
father and his brother, but Cherry was for a while employed in getting
for Fairstar (1) <i>The dancing water</i>, which had the gift of imparting
beauty; (2) <i>The singing apple</i>, which had the gift of imparting wit;
and (3) <i>The green bird</i>, which could reveal all secrets. By this bird
the story of their birth was made known, and Fairstar married her cousin
Cherry.&mdash;Comtesse D'Aunoy, <i>Fairy Tales</i> (&quot;Princess Fair-star,&quot; 1682).</p>

<p><b>Fakenham Ghost</b> <i>(The).</i> An old woman, walking to Fakenham, had to
cross the churchyard after nightfall. She heard a short, quick step
behind, and looking round saw what she fancied to be a four-footed
monster. On she ran, faster and faster, and on came the pattering
footfalls behind. She gained the churchyard gate and pushed it open,
but, ah! &quot;the monster&quot; also passed through. Every moment she expected it
would leap upon her back. She reached her cottage door and fainted. Out
came her husband with a lantern, saw the &quot;sprite,&quot; which was no other
than the foal of a donkey, that had strayed into the park and followed
the ancient dame to her cottage door.</p>

young wife named Angioli'na (3 <i>syl</i>.). At a banquet, Michel Steno, a
young patrician, grossly insulted some of the ladies, and was, by the
order of the doge, turned out of the house. In revenge, Steno placarded
the doge's chair with some scurrilous verses upon the young dogaressa,
and Faliero referred the matter to &quot;the Forty.&quot; The council sentenced
Steno to two months' imprisonment, and the doge deemed this punishment
so inadequate to the offence, that he looked upon it as a personal
insult, and headed a conspiracy to cut off, root and branch, the whole
Venetian nobility. The project being discovered, Faliero was put to
death (1355), at the age of 76, and his picture removed from the gallery
of his brother doges.&mdash;Byron, <i>Marino Faliero.</i></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
